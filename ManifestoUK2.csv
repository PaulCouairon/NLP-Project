"coordinated action on climate change,",107,58
"equality,",503,59
"workers rights,",701,60
"an economy that works for people and planet at a human scale,",416,61
"and real care for the future,",501,63
including young people now.,706,64
"Imagine a world in which we protect the planet, its land and its oceans, and the plants, animals and people that live on it.",501,65
"Imagine a world of security for all,",503,66
"of social security as opportunity not dependency,",504,67
"of lives lived more locally, with services close to where people need them",503,68
"and connected by affordable, energy-efficient public transport.",501,69
"Imagine a government that believes in society,",606,70
"in our common humanity,",606,71
"in a culture of hope,",606,72
and in our capacity to govern ourselves.,606,73
"Imagine a government that believes in the common good,",606,74
"and that the best way of achieving it is by working for each other, rather than against each other.",606,75
Imagine honest government.,304,76
Thats the world the Green Party wants to make real.,606,77
Its also the world that most of us want.,606,78
"When asked to vote for policies rather than parties or personalities, Green policies consistently come out on top.",501,79
And its so different from what we have now.,305,80
"In consumer societies like ours, the common good has been forgotten.",606,81
"So much government has been outsourced, put out to tender.",606,82
The reins have been handed over to the unfettered market and big corporations.,403,83
"They are given as the reason why we cant do things (such as bring the railways back into public ownership),",413,84
why we must do things (lower taxes for the rich),503,85
and how we must do things (privatise public utilities).,413,86
"When government has been active its been to make the rich richer and the poor poorer,",503,87
while blocking action to prevent ecological catastrophe.,501,88
This has had disastrous consequences for the common good and for the protection of the natural world.,501,89
"Back in the 1970s a determined assault on public life began, and the market became the model and measure of life.",416,90
"Since then, successive governments of all colours have found ways to justify and deepen the role of the market in our lives.",416,91
"Local government? Check out your nearest website or leaflet: youre likely to be referred to as a customer, not a citizen.",301,92
Privatisation? Look at one of the most recent  Royal Mail.,413,93
"This was owned by you and me, then it was sold for a song,",606,94
with windfall profits for companies doing the only job the market really understands  maximising shareholder profit.,403,95
"The public lost £1 billion, while George Osbornes best mans hedge fund pocketed £36 million.",304,96
Outsourcing? This is what governments do when theyve given up governing.,304,97
"The result is a series of scandals from companies with increasingly infamous names  G4S, SERCO, ATOS  over which we have no control.",403,98
"Zero-hours contracts? These are designed for companies looking to maximise profits through labour flexibility, but hopeless if you have regular bills to pay.",701,99
The market has been in charge for so long that it dominates our imagination and colours our view of ourselves.,403,100
The market is short sighted and short term.,403,101
Its time for change  time to put the market to work for the common good and for people to be put back in charge.,403,102
The Green Party knows that:,305,103
Its hard to be a citizen when life tells you that you are a consumer;,606,104
Its hard to think of others when we are pitted against one another and sold the lie that individuals are to blame for their misfortunes;,606,105
and Its hard to think of the common good when its never mentioned.,606,106
Private interests have ruled the roost for far too long.,403,107
"The result is a society scarred by inequalities of power and wealth,",503,108
and a planet plundered of resources and damaged by pollution.,501,109
All in it together? We dont think so.,606,110
Those with power and wealth have done very well out of austerity:,503,111
the UKs wealthiest 1% grab more than anywhere else in Europe.,503,112
"Politics has fragmented, public institutions have weakened, peoples lives are dominated by insecurity, and prejudice is rife.",202,113
"We live in a price-tag society  and if you cant pay the price, too bad.",503,114
Things that used to be done by public agencies have been outsourced.,413,115
Once it was a duty for all of us to look after the vulnerable when times were hard.,606,116
"We paid taxes into a common fund to look after the poor, the weak, the old and the sick, and to educate the young.",606,117
"This is what we did as citizens, bound together by what we share rather than separated by what divides us.",606,118
"Now care has been outsourced to charity, to food banks.",503,119
"Some think this is a sign of the Big Society, but we think its the sign of a failed society.",503,120
Individual charity is no substitute for collective justice.,503,121
For 40 years the rich and powerful have forced us to live in their fantasy world  a world that suits the minority not the majority.,503,122
"This is a world imagined from the point of view of the healthy, the wealthy and the privileged.",503,123
"Where there is a satisfying job just round the corner if only we could be bothered to look for it,",503,124
"where resources are limitless,",503,125
and where the only obstacle to total fulfilment is the psychology of individual failure.,503,126
"Meanwhile, in the real world where most of us live, we are young and old, sometimes poor and sick, jobs are scarce,",503,127
"the Earth groans under the weight of our demands,",501,128
and the obstacles in the way of our flourishing can be stubborn and unyielding.,503,129
How should we organise life in this real world?,503,130
Do we want our security to depend on the underpaid zero-hours worker,701,131
"of an outsourced company, maximising shareholder profit?",403,132
"No, we want well-trained, committed workers, properly paid and secure in their own lives",701,133
 because our well-being is linked to everyone elses.,606,134
Do we want a world in which privatisation is the solution for everything?,413,135
"Or have we learnt from energy, water and rail that down that road lies private gain rather than the common good?",413,136
Its public ownership and democratic control that lead to fairer services and better outcomes.,413,137
"The market makes us impatient with the suffering of others, tolerant of inequality, prone to prejudice, suspicious of difference.",403,138
"We know we can be cooperative, appreciative, understanding and fair.",606,139
We just need a world that encourages us to be these things.,107,140
Together we can create that world.,107,141
"The challenges that lie ahead of us are unique in their combination: declining resources,",701,142
"global warming,",701,143
"deepening inequality,",701,144
footloose capital.,416,145
"But these problems have been created by us, so they can be solved by us.",107,146
We need to remake society.,606,147
"And in this remaking we need finally to realise that consumer capitalism is the problem, not the solution.",416,148
The solution lies in a democratically managed economy,202,149
that operates within the Earths resource limits.,416,150
"We dont want a privatised outsourced state, we want a green and democratic one.",202,151
"We want a public National Health Service, not privatised healthcare.",413,152
"The uncoordinated actions of millions of individuals, with unequal access to wealth and power and urged to maximise their own interests without regard for anyone elses, will only deepen the crisis.",606,153
"This is whats on offer from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, from Labour and from UKIP.",305,154
"We need a party prepared to challenge the damage this has done, a party that expects something better.",305,155
We need a party prepared for the real world.,305,156
We need a party for the common good.,606,157
We need the Green Party.,501,158
"Imagine having a secure, fulfilling and decently paid job, knowing that you are working to live and not living to work.",701,159
"Imagine coming home to an affordable flat or house, and being valued for your contribution and character, not for how much you earn.",503,160
Imagine knowing that you and your friends are part of an economy that works with the planet rather than against it.,416,161
Imagine food banks going out of business.,503,162
Imagine the end of poverty and deprivation.,503,163
The key to all this is to put the economy at the service of people and planet rather than the other way round.,501,164
Thats what the Green Party will do.,501,165
The main issue for many at this election is the economy.,408,167
Many people have very practical worries:,503,168
Is my job secure?,701,169
Will our family have enough this month to pay the bills and put food on the table?,503,170
Can we keep paying the mortgage or the rent?,503,171
Will we have to continue to work unreasonably long or unpredictable hours?,701,172
Is my pay fair compared with others?,701,173
Will my benefits be cut?,504,174
Will I ever get a pension?,504,175
Will I ever get a job with a future?,701,176
Will I ever pay off my student loan?,504,177
Will I ever find a decent place to live?,503,178
Will the economy provide a decent livelihood long into the future for our children and grandchildren?,503,179
Our solutions to these worries are very different from the other parties.,416,180
The Coalition parties and Labour agree on one thing about the economy: its got to grow because growth is the answer to everything.,416,181
"If the costs include ruining our climate and countryside by exploiting shale gas, tolerating massive inequality and the insecurity of zero-hours contracts or massive underemployment  then too bad.",416,182
We dont agree with the growth objective.,416,183
"Our economic policy promotes a fair, just and more equal society",503,184
while recognising that we live on a finite planet.,501,185
Its easy to forget the fact that everything we make and everything we buy comes from the Earth.,501,186
And we have only one of them.,501,187
"If everyone on Earth consumed at the rate we do in the UK, wed need nearly three planets to sustain us.",416,188
"If its the average North American, then wed need nearly four planets.",416,189
Greens are sometimes accused of being unrealistic about economics.,416,190
Nothing could be further from the truth.,416,191
"Its our opponents who are the fantasists, believing that continual growth is possible on a finite planet",416,192
". Greens are the realists, understanding that the planet imposes limits and focusing on essentials such as jobs, housing and the household budget.",416,193
"The economy depends on society,",606,194
which depends on the Earth and its resources.,501,195
Thats the order of things  not the other way round.,501,196
"And whats growth for, anyway?",416,197
"The aim of politics is to help us flourish, and by this measure growth has failed in recent decades.",416,198
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) tells us that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person has grown by more than three times since 1955, allowing for inflation.",416,199
Are we three or four times more content?,416,200
"No, levels of life satisfaction have dropped in this period.",416,201
Were told that growth has returned to the UK.,416,202
The result? More than one in four children is growing up in poverty.,416,203
The bosses of the UKs 100 biggest companies earn on average 143 times more than their staff.,416,204
The top 1% of the population has the same wealth as the bottom 55%.,503,205
Five families in the UK have the same wealth as 12 million UK citizens.,503,206
"913,138 people received three days emergency food from Trussell Trust food banks in 201314 compared with 346,992 in 201213.",503,207
Debt levels are growing.,416,208
"By 2018, 2 million households are expected to spend more than half their disposable income repaying loans.",416,209
Household incomes adjusted for inflation are still on average 2% below what they were in 200910.,503,210
Joining up the policies.,305,211
"Government is run too much by Departments, which rarely take any notice of each other.",303,212
Greens like to join things up...,305,213
"So what do social justice and greater equality have to do with health, education, opportunity, the numbers in prison, and even recycling?",503,214
This manifesto has many other policies designed to improve all these things.,503,215
But just making us more equal will improve all of them.,503,216
"So its not the economy, stupid.",416,217
Or at least not one that grows forever.,416,218
The Green Party believes that equality is much more important than growth.,416,219
And growth doesnt bring equality; in fact it helps to justify inequality.,416,220
The result of the corrosive trickle-down fantasy is plain: the sixth-richest society in the world is disfigured by high levels of deprivation.,416,221
And its not only those right at the bottom who have problems.,416,222
"Despite the fact that household incomes are now back to 200708 levels, families on ordinary incomes have faced a real squeeze since 200910 as prices go up and incomes stagnate.",503,223
We will abandon GDP and the pursuit of growth as a measure of economic success.,416,224
"We would use a measure of Adjusted National Product (ANP), which would take account of capital and environmental depreciation and include the value of many things not currently paid for, such as unpaid work at home.",416,225
Green councillors mobilise alternatives to payday lenders...,305,226
"In a move to break peoples dependence on payday lenders, in Stowmarket, Suffolk, Councillor John Matthissen is leading a cross-agency project to launch a collection and information point for the local credit union.",403,227
"We make an important distinction between short-term growth, or regeneration, and long-term dependency on continuing economic growth.",409,229
"The measures we propose as alternatives to austerity will, by halting and reversing the cuts to public services, restore lost jobs and create new ones.",409,230
"The increased economic activity will cause the economy to grow rather than shrink in the short term, restoring employment and living standards.",409,231
"However, we see such short-term growth as transitional, as a side-effect of ending the failed austerity project.",409,232
We do not see it as a contradiction to adapting the economy for One-Planet Living in the longer term.,107,233
There is an alternative to austerity.,408,235
The crunch of 2008 was the result of the pressures of our consumer society and an unregulated finance system; people borrowed too much and banks were too willing to lend.,403,236
"Now people and businesses are paying down their debts, businesses contract haphazardly and workers are laid off.",403,237
"The Coalitions reaction was to use this as an excuse to impose austerity  in order to cut the debt, especially the governments deficit  while doing little to strengthen the economy.",410,238
"The winners are those who absorb corporate surpluses, the chief executives and the shareholders.",403,239
"The biggest losers are the unemployed, the low paid and the vulnerable, especially those who depend on public services.",403,240
Labour plans to match the Tories fiscal envelope for Departmental spending  code for more austerity.,408,241
We think the economy should work for us all.,410,242
We want a One-Planet economy that will address the challenge of climate change and unacceptable levels of inequality.,107,243
We have to throw off the shackles of market ideology and consider afresh what really needs to be done.,403,244
We need to: Ensure that everyone who wants one has a decent secure job paid at least a living wage.,412,245
So we have to encourage and create jobs.,701,246
"In total, the policies in this manifesto will create over 1 million jobs.",701,247
See the section on Work in Chapter 9.,701,248
Address the issue of climate change.,501,249
We need huge investment in using energy more efficiently and generating energy sustainably.,501,250
This will not happen without public investment.,501,251
See Chapter 4 on Energy and Climate.,501,252
"Stabilise and tightly regulate the financial sector, whose greed and recklessness have been a major cause of our recent economic difficulties and of growing inequality.",403,253
See the section on Finance in Chapter 9.,403,254
"Provide equality and security in a mixed economy by committing to the common good, a larger public sector and higher taxation, funding our health, education and local services properly, and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.",403,255
See the section on Taxes in Chapter 9.,403,256
Be prepared to borrow on good terms to fund investment rather than making closing the deficit the main objective of our economic policy.,409,257
The plans in this manifesto require borrowing of £338 billion (in real 2015 terms) over the Parliament as compared with the Coalitions plan in the 2015 Budget to borrow £115 billion.,409,258
"If monetary policy demands quantitative easing, we will spend that money directly on green investment.",501,259
"However, the programme of public spending and taxation in this manifesto would show a surplus on the current account (that is, excluding investment) of 2.7% by the end of the Parliament.",408,260
Reject the dogma that everything is best done by the private sector.,403,261
"A sensible economy is a mixed economy, where some things  health, education and public transport, for example  are better in community or public ownership.",403,262
"See Chapters 6, 7 and 12 on Health, Education and Transport.",403,263
Support those without jobs and treat them with respect in a system that makes getting some work worthwhile,701,264
`and provides pensions that allow older people to live with dignity.,504,265
`See Chapter 10 on Social Security.,504,266
"Mobilise the talents and energy of everyone and serve everyone,",503,267
"`including the young and the old, men and women, those who are disabled and minority groups, including ethnic minorities and different sexual orientations.",503,268
See Chapter 5 on Equalities.,503,269
Recognise that not everything that is valuable has a price attached to it.,503,270
Create a robust taxation system that promotes equality,503,272
and sustainability.,501,273
Rein in huge companies that put shareholder returns ahead of the common good.,403,274
"Foster institutional change in the economy that we want, with changes to company law",403,275
and encouragement for small firms and mutuals.,403,276
See the Changing Economic Organisations and Small Firms sections in Chapter 9.,403,277
Create an efficient economy that encourages innovation and the use of science but does not rely on dangerous technologies.,416,278
See the Science section in Chapter 3.,416,279
"Foster an economy that is open to Europe and the wider world, that accepts people will move from country to country",107,280
and that is willing to assist countries poorer than ours.,107,281
See Chapter 13 on International Affairs.,107,282
Ensure that the Treasurys priority objective is to deliver an economy with these aims.,107,283
How we will do this is set out in detail in the following chapters.,305,284
The third planet from the sun.,501,286
Our home.,501,287
Home to 9 million other species.,501,288
The only planet with liquid water at its surface.,501,289
The only planet in the solar system with 21% oxygen.,501,290
"As far as we know, the only planet in the solar system that sustains life.",501,291
"Imagine a political party that prioritises the protection of the land, the seas and their inhabitants.",501,292
Imagine one that believes that animals have a right to flourish and arent just a means to the end of human satisfaction.,501,293
Imagine one that believes the common good embraces other species and not just our own.,501,294
"Thats what a real political party, the Green Party, does.",501,295
"The Earth is our home, and this is what we are doing to it: We have lost half the wild animals on Earth in the past 40 years.",501,296
"We lose between 200 and 100,000 species every year.",501,297
"This is between 1,000 and 10,000 times faster than the natural extinction rate.",501,298
We are causing a sixth extinction.,501,299
The other five occurred naturally; this one is down to us.,501,300
We have increased CO2 concentrations from a pre-industrial 280 parts per million (ppm) to about 400 ppm.,501,301
Global temperatures are due to rise between 1.5 and 4.8 degrees C by 2100.,501,302
And thats just the internationally agreed range without feedback effects.,501,303
Many experts are predicting rises as high as 6 degrees C.,501,304
For the first time in the history of the Earth one species is changing it forever  the human species.,501,305
They call this new era the Anthropocene.,501,306
We now have our very own geological epoch.,501,307
"This brings with it massive responsibilities, which no other party understands or acknowledges.",501,308
"The rich and powerful, in particular, have spent too long treating the Earth like an indestructible storehouse, to be thoughtlessly pillaged of its natural resources.",416,309
"UK biodiversity is threatened by development and agricultural practices such as intensive farming, the draining of wetlands and the deforesting of hills.",501,310
Genetic selection is causing endemic health and welfare problems in domestic and farmed animals.,501,311
Animal experimentation is still routine; millions of animals suffer pain and death every year in the UK.,501,312
Overfishing is devastating marine ecosystems.,501,313
"Our attitude to the natural world is epitomised by the fact that some circuses still tour with wild animals, including zebras, lions, snakes, tigers and camels.",501,314
The Green Party will put policies in place that will stop us treating other species and the wider environment as a means to the satisfaction of humans only.,501,315
This is because the common good includes other species too.,501,316
We depend on them for our own welfare.,501,317
Every second breath we take is made possible by phytoplankton releasing oxygen into the oceans.,501,318
"As the oceans acidify and heat up through global warming, their capacity to fix CO2 and release oxygen is compromised.",501,319
"This is interdependence at work, and we ride roughshod over it at our peril.",501,320
But we should also care for other species because the planet is their home too; we share it with them and we need to take their interests and well-being  as well as ours  into account.,501,321
We need to halt the damage to nature in the UK and return protection of our natural landscapes to a central part in our national life.,501,323
"The time has come for a new legal framework for the protection of landscape and wildlife, and we would promote a new Nature and Well-being Act.",501,324
"On landscape and habitats we will: Protect, expand, properly fund and improve non-car access to our National Parks.",501,325
Make good the Coalitions unfulfilled promise to protect forests through a Forests Protection Bill.,501,326
"Reduce dramatically the use of pesticides and prioritise non-chemical farming methods through improved agri-environment schemes, legislation, education and the promotion of good practice in all farming,",501,327
as well as increased support for organic farming.,703,328
"Secure protection of rural residents and communities from exposure to pesticides sprayed on nearby crop fields and prohibit the use of pesticides in the locality of homes, schools and childrens playgrounds.",501,329
Improve the management of woodlands through new planting and the local use of sustainable woodland products.,501,330
"Aim to ensure through planning that everyone lives within five minutes walk of a green open space,",501,331
and ensure local authorities have the resources to extend and maintain local parks.,501,332
"Introduce a nature improvement area in every town, city and county.",501,333
"Help bees by reducing pesticide use (banning neonicotinoids),",501,334
"greening farming,",703,335
improving planning guidelines to preserve/ create bee habitats,501,336
and making bees a priority species in biodiversity strategies.,501,337
"Promote landscape-scale conservation,",501,338
"using reform of the Common Agricultural Policy,",110,339
improved agri-environment schemes,501,340
and the planning system.,501,341
"In particular, all farm payments should be designed to protect the soil,",501,342
"reduce flood risk,",501,343
"conserve wildlife,",501,344
"improve water quality,",501,345
increase recreation,501,346
and assist carbon capture.,501,347
We would also include protecting ecosystems in our aid for developing countries.,107,348
"Repeal the National Planning Policy Framework and in particular its presumption in favour of development,",416,349
"and put planning back in the hands of local people and government,",301,350
while requiring local authorities to map local ecological networks and work collaboratively to develop national spatial plans.,501,351
"Increase the amount of land offered long-term protection through the European Unions Birds Directive and Habitats Directive,",108,352
make sure these directives are properly enforced,108,353
and defend them in the EU against attempts to weaken them.,108,354
"Work with local communities, scientists and conservation groups to expand the UKs network of Marine Conservation Zones to create areas specifically for the protection of mobile species",501,355
as well as reference areas off limits to fishing and other extractive activities.,501,356
Play our part in creating a Southern Atlantic Reserve and champion internationally the protection of the Arctic.,107,357
"Produce a strategy for capturing carbon and reducing greenhouse gases through improved land management, for example by encouraging and preserving peatlands.",501,358
"Because of the interaction between water supply and the wider environment, require Ofwat (the Water Services Regulation Authority) and the Environment Agency to work together to create a healthy water environment",501,359
and long-term low prices for consumers.,412,360
"In particular, build new reservoirs in the south and east of England.",501,361
Prohibit developers from being allowed to destroy unique habitats by way of biodiversity offsetting elsewhere.,416,362
"Because 94% of the biodiversity for which the UK is responsible is found in our Overseas Territories, ensure that conservation of the environment of the Overseas Territories, including their marine areas, is funded to a level equal to their global significance.",107,363
"We would also immediately extend ratification of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity to all uninhabited territories,",107,364
and work with territory governments to agree a timeline for ratification of the Convention in all inhabited territories.,107,365
Greens in power carry out our policies,305,366
The Green-led administration in Brighton has secured open access to more green space in perpetuity.,501,367
"It declared over 800 acres of Council-owned downland and farmland as open access land, meaning residents can freely use land that was once closed to them.",501,368
"It added another 670 acres in July 2014, protected in perpetuity.",501,369
"Market forces and government policies have favoured increasing industrialisation of agriculture, mass-produced food and dependence on fossil fuels.",416,371
"This comes with great external costs to the environment, human health, farming people and animal welfare.",416,372
"Soil erosion, depletion of water resources, pollution, loss of biodiversity and animal suffering are commonplace.",416,373
"In addition, agriculture accounts for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions,",416,374
and pressure on land resources is linked with deforestation in many parts of the world.,416,375
"But food supply and farming are not just another business, and we need to ensure: That nutritious food is available to everyone at prices they can afford;",416,376
Decent rural livelihoods and support for rural communities;,416,377
That there is national and international food security;,416,378
That farming respects the environment and treats farm animals well.,501,379
To secure these objectives we will: Seek to reform the Common Agricultural Policy,110,380
"and reform our national agri-environment schemes to prioritise and support farmers who farm sustainably and enhance biodiversity on farmed land with a variety of farming styles, methods and scales.",701,381
"Foster environmentally sustainable agriculture, land management and a secure food supply by properly supporting valid, rigorous and reliable research into all areas and types of farming including organic farming.",416,382
"Encourage farming to operate in fair trade conditions, which guarantee a decent livelihood for farmers at home and also in countries that export food to the UK.",416,383
Protect productive farmland from development except for that associated with agriculture and those engaged in it.,416,384
"In particular, review the current classification of farm land to maximise local production of food.",416,385
Work to reduce food imports and increase home and local food production where feasible.,416,386
Increase localisation of the food chain and encourage direct sales via local markets;,416,387

and enable them to gain independence from disadvantageous contracts with supermarkets by strengthening the powers of the supermarket ombudsman.,403,389
"Help hospitals and schools and other food buyers in the public sector to lead the way in buying sustainable products,",416,390
and encourage children to be involved in growing and cooking food.,416,391
"Work to ensure sustainable fishing policies, leading to sustainable fishing communities, at both the national and European levels as appropriate.",416,392
"In particular, fishing quota allocations should reward local sustainable fisheries.",406,393
"Research, promote and support farming methods that reduce greenhouse gas emissions,",501,394
enable carbon storage,501,395
"and have minimum impact on wildlife, as established by rigorous and reliable research.",501,396
"In particular, we should encourage eating less and better meat.",501,397
"Support a moratorium, at national and EU level, on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in all agricultural systems, including production of human food and animal feed, and on importation of GM food or feed.",501,398
Work to reduce food waste.,501,399
Green councillors promote local food...,501,400
"Councillor Molly Scott Cato in Stroud secured £100,000 in the District Council budget to invest in local food production for everyone.",501,401
"In a rural area like Stroud, it makes sense to support local food producers so that everyone can eat food grown within the district, she said.",501,402
"We support calls for a new Commission on Animal Protection, which would cover animal protection issues in all the areas specifically addressed below.",501,405
"In farming, we must move away from the intensification and industrialisation of animal farming.",501,406
Sustainable farming means animals freed from cages and returned to the land.,501,407
We will end factory farming and enforce strict animal welfare standards.,501,408
In particular we will work for: A complete ban on cages for hens and rabbits,501,409
and on zero-grazing units for dairy cows.,501,410
Improved food labelling and better traceability of our food to prevent further food scandals such as the horse meat scandal;,403,411
mandatory labelling of meat and dairy products as to method of production and method of slaughter.,501,412
Mandatory CCTV in all slaughterhouses.,501,413
"Tougher regulations on animal transportation, including a maximum limit of 8 hours and an end to live export from the UK.",501,414
"Action to stop the overuse of antibiotics in intensive animal farming,",501,415
with mandatory targets and surveillance of the human health impacts.,501,416
A ban on the production and sale of foie gras.,501,417
A ban on the cloning of farm animals and on the sale of meat and milk from these animals.,501,418
Ending genetic selection for fast growth or high yields where this results in compromised welfare such as ill health or pain.,416,419
Protection for British farmers from low-welfare imports.,406,420
"So what do farming, health, insurance and carbon dioxide emissions have to do with each other?",501,422
"Good farming respects ecology, promotes biodiversity and encourages us to get out and enjoy the wildlife and landscape, improving both our mental and our physical health.",501,423
"And local food saves food miles, combating climate change,",501,424
"while good land management can retain water, reducing flooding and our insurance premiums.",501,425
Illegal wildlife trade is causing great suffering; it devastates species across the globe and is linked to other serious organised crimes.,501,426
"Greens will implement: Increased support and resources to build expertise in wildlife crime within the justice sector,",501,427
"including: strengthening sentencing in this area,",605,428
"gathering data on the trade,",501,429
ensuring police forces implement local strategies,605,430
and ensuring funding of the Wildlife Crime Unit.,501,431
A ban on the import of exotic pets.,501,432
An end to the keeping of primates as household pets.,501,433
Enhanced public education and awareness to reduce demand.,501,434
Allocation of resources to support other countries in tackling poaching and human/wildlife conflict.,107,435
On other animal protection issues we would: Maintain and strengthen the ban on hunting with dogs,501,436
and extend this ban to all hunting of all animals for sport or pleasure.,501,437
End the badger cull (see Badger culls box).,501,438
End the use of snares.,501,439
End the practice of grouse shooting and other sport shooting.,501,440
End the use of all animals in circuses.,501,441
End the use of the whip in horse racing and conduct a full review of the sport.,501,442
Take action over other sports or entertainment that cause suffering to animals.,501,443
Ensure UK taxpayers money is not used to fund bullfighting.,501,444
Ensure greater protection for racing greyhounds and initiate a formal independent review of the industry.,501,445
Ban the import of fur products.,501,446
"Work for stronger international protection of endangered sea creatures, and an end to the killing of porpoises, whales and dolphins in all waters and keeping these animals for commercial purposes.",107,447
Badger culls  inhumane and unscientific,501,448
"The Green Party has been strongly opposed to the badger cull from the outset, saying that all the evidence showed it would be both inhumane and ineffective at tackling bovine tuberculosis.",501,449
"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) controversially went ahead with culling by free shooting in Gloucestershire and Somerset in 2013.",501,450
"The trial was a failure, being shown to be both inhumane and ineffective, as predicted.",501,451
The Coalition has nonetheless chosen to continue to pursue this strategy.,501,452
In October 2012 Green MP Caroline Lucas secured a major parliamentary debate to challenge the governments badger policy and led MPs in a successful vote against it.,501,453
"Greens want to see an end to all animal experimentation and will ensure that research funding is directed away from failing animal disease models and towards modern human biology-based techniques, which offering greater opportunities to cure disease and improve product safety.",501,454
"We will work to end animal experiments but believe immediate action must be taken to Stop non-medical experiments, experiments using primates, cats and dogs.",501,455
End the use of live animals in military training.,501,456
Stop the breeding of and use of genetically altered animals.,501,457
"End government funding of animal experimentation, including any that is outsourced to other countries.",501,458
Provide greater funding for non-animal research methods and link funding to a target for developing of humane alternatives to animal experiments.,501,459
"Increase transparency and ensure publication of all findings of animal research, including negative findings.",501,460
Introduce a comprehensive system for reviewing animal experiments and initiate a comparison of currently required animal tests with a set of human biology-based tests.,501,461
"On companion animals Greens will push to: Completely review and update existing dog legislation, particularly relating to dog control.",501,462
Ensure properly coordinated action on dog fighting.,501,463
Update the rules on selling animals and tackle problems associated with online advertising of pets and illegal imports.,501,464
Introduce mandatory licensing of breeders and control on genetic manipulation through breeding to prevent exaggerated characteristics likely to cause suffering.,501,465
End puppy farming by banning the sale of young puppies unless the mother is present.,501,466
Introduce regulations that make it illegal to use aversive training aids such as electric shock collars.,501,467
Greens in power carry out our policies,501,468
"In Brighton, the Green-led Council ensures that new Council tenancy agreements include a requirement that dogs living in council owned homes should be micro-chipped.",501,469
This has encouraged more tenants who own dogs to behave responsibly as their pets are much easier to trace.,501,470
Greens are pro-science.,411,472
Our policies on everything from climate change to eradicating bovine TB are based on the best possible scientific evidence.,411,473
"But just because science allows us to do something, that does not mean that we should do it.",416,474
We oppose nuclear power,416,475
and the release of genetically modified crops into the environment.,416,476
"We need to balance our scientific and technological abilities against the social, economic and ethical consequences of using them",416,477
 including their impact on future generations and other species.,416,478
"Greens will support the development of technologies that have strong social, economic and environmental benefits.",416,479
"That is why we support investment in energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy//,",416,480
which will be vital in helping to secure improvements in peoples quality of life,416,481
and to combating climate change.,501,482
"We would: Ensure that adequate government funding goes to research on major environmental issues such as climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss,",501,483
and less is spent on military research.,105,484
"Ensure that basic research is adequately funded and is not controlled by large corporations,",403,485
and gradually increase public spending on scientific research from 0.5% to 1.0% of GDP over the next ten years.,411,486
"Ensure that scientific research is conducted ethically, with regard in particular to human and animal welfare.",501,487
Publish freely the results of all publicly funded research.,403,488
Prevent the patenting of genes and living organisms.,403,489
What scientists say So... the Green Party... a party of sentimental tree-huggers?,501,490
"Yes, we do love trees, and many of us take great moral and spiritual solace from the natural world.",501,491
"But we are also a party of science, and we listen to scientists.",411,492
"First, the worlds 1.3 billion poorest people need to be raised out of extreme poverty.",701,494
"This is critical to reducing global inequality, and to ensuring the wellbeing of all people...",701,495
"Second, in the most developed and the emerging economies unsustainable consumption must be urgently reduced.",416,496
This will entail scaling back or radical transformation of damaging material consumption and emissions,416,497
"and the adoption of sustainable technologies, and is critical to ensuring a sustainable future for all...",416,498
"Third, global population growth needs to be slowed and stabilised, but this should by no means be coercive.",501,499
We agree.,501,500
"In the General Election you can vote for the only real party of science or for the parties of neo-liberal economic ideology, which believe in the illusion that we can continue to expand forever on a finite planet.",501,501
"Reducing the amount of waste we produce and being more careful about how we dispose of it has benefits for our planet, our economy and society as a whole.",501,503
We want to move towards a jobs-rich circular economy with as much waste minimisation as possible.,501,504
"We would: Reduce what we use, reuse it when we have finished with it and recycle as a last resort.",501,505
Provide the framework and the infrastructure to help people make more positive choices.,501,506
Use taxation and regulation to ensure that products and packaging are designed with a view to what happens to them when they stop being useful and packaging reduced.,501,507
We want waste designed out and fixing things  making them last  designed in.,501,508
Follow Scotland in banning waste food and other organic material being sent to landfill.,501,509
"Increase national spending on recycling and waste disposal by about 50%, an extra £4 billion a year, so that we can do away with damaging incineration and landfill.",501,510
Aim to recycle 70% of domestic waste by 2020 as a move towards a zero-waste system.,501,511
"Imagine flicking a switch and knowing that the energy was coming from the sun, the wind, the earth and the tides; energy forever, not just for now.",501,513
Imagine not having to decide between heating or eating; no fuel poverty,503,514
Imagine glancing out of the window and seeing a van arrive to insulate your neighbours house as part of a funded nationwide programme  reducing demand as well as creating supply.,501,515
Imagine your energy bill coming from a community-owned company or cooperative rather than from one of the Big Six.,403,516
Imagine being part of the company or cooperative yourself; energy security for us all rather than profits for the few.,403,517
This is all possible; this is Green Party energy policy.,403,518
Energy for all without climate change.,501,519
We all use energy.,503,520
"It keeps our houses warm, powers much of our transport and home appliances, and cooks our food.",503,521
"Our lives depend on it and it takes up a large part of our spending, especially if we are poor.",503,522
Too many people suffer fuel poverty.,503,523
We get a bad deal on energy.,403,524
"When wholesale prices go up, the prices for domestic electricity and for fuel at the pumps go up rapidly.",403,525
"When wholesale prices go down, the retail prices seem to stick.",403,526
The big energy companies make huge profits but do not serve the common good.,403,527
We need to put this right and ensure that: Everyone is able to cook and keep warm;,403,528
"We are charged for what we use, and not penalised for using less;",403,529
We are not cut off or forced to use pre-payment meters.,403,530
But burning fossil fuels for energy causes climate change.,501,531
"If we are to secure a safe and habitable climate for current and future generations, we need a rapid shift to a zero-carbon energy system;",501,532
we need to leave the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves underground and unburned.,501,533
"Other ways of getting energy, such as nuclear power, pose other unacceptable risks.",501,534
So we have to build a secure and affordable energy system that meets our basic needs while protecting our environment.,416,535
"We believe this requires an energy policy that: Reduces the amount of energy we need, mainly by improving energy efficiency.",416,536
Ends fuel poverty.,503,537
Invests massively in renewable generation.,416,538
"Reorganises the energy generation and supply industry, in particular breaking the dominance of the Big Six suppliers.",403,539
"Puts community, cooperative and locally owned clean energy generation and supply at the heart of our energy system.",416,540
"We have to start with climate change, because this drives the degree of urgency with which we change our energy system.",501,541
The climate is the ultimate common good.,501,543
"The effects of a rapidly warming climate will affect everyone, but poorer people, in the UK and worldwide, will be the hardest hit.",503,544
"Many are already struggling to cope with rising sea levels, flooding, drought and extreme weather.",501,545
Climate change threatens to make parts of the world uninhabitable.,501,546
Climate refugee numbers will increase.,501,547
More intense weather events will further affect health and food production and make global conflict more likely.,501,548
"The science makes it clear that, to avoid the risk of runaway climate change, we must leave around four-fifths of all existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground.",501,549
So the problem now is not too little fossil fuel but too much.,501,550
Exploiting new sources of unconventional fossil fuels such as shale gas and oil and tar sands is incompatible with tackling climate change.,501,551
"We must reduce our dependency on oil, coal and gas as quickly as possible while developing a society that can thrive on renewable energy.",501,552
And theres not much time.,501,553
"To have a reasonable chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change, we need a 90% reduction in greenhouse gases in the UK in the next 1520 years",501,554
and a zero-carbon economy by 2050 (see the box for how we derive these targets).,501,555
This is much more challenging than the 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 in the Climate Change Act 2008.,501,556
"Although we celebrate, defend and uphold the Climate Change Act, it must also be strengthened.",501,557
"A Green transformation would have huge benefits: more comfortable homes,",501,558
"better health,",501,559
"less pollution,",501,560
"lots of jobs,",501,561
and far less dependency on foreign fuel imports.,501,562
The UK can and must do better: The governments climate change advisers say we are on track to miss even the governments unsatisfactory carbon targets.,501,563
Progress on energy efficiency has plummeted.,501,564
The governments Green Deal to save energy in our homes has been a disappointing failure.,501,565
"The UK is 25th out of 27 in the European renewable energy league table, despite having some of the best resources for renewable energy in Europe.",501,566
We have the highest level of fuel poverty in Western Europe.,503,567
Why we need to do better than the Climate Change Act,501,568
"If the global average temperature rise can be kept below 2 degrees C, runaway or disastrous climate change can be avoided,",501,569
though severe damage will occur in some parts of the world.,107,570
"Many countries and civil society organisations argue that the international goal should be to keep to 1.5 degrees C of warming, highlighting the severity of the climate impacts we are already seeing.",107,571
"All countries including the UK agreed at Copenhagen in 2009 to recognise the need to limit the average temperature rise to below 2 degrees C, despite the fact that the UKs climate change target means that there is an almost two-thirds (63%) chance of exceeding this 2 degrees C.",107,572
"To meet the 2 degree C target, the world needs to limit total global emissions over the rest of the century to about 1,000 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2.",107,573
"Current projections have us exceeding that figure by 2040, leading to devastating average warming of around 4 degrees C by the end of this century.",501,574
"As the UK has about 1% of the worlds population, its allowable budget would amount to 10 Gt CO2.",701,575
But the UK is a relatively rich country that has benefited from the worlds highest cumulative historical emissions per person.,503,576
"The Green Party therefore believes that the UK should plan to emit only half this amount by 2030 (which amounts to around 80 million tonnes CO2 a year by 2030),",503,577
and have negligible emissions thereafter.,501,578
This translates into our target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 10% of their 1990 levels by 2030.,501,579
This goes much further than the 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 mandated by the Climate Change Act.,501,580
"Renewables can supply all the energy we need for a comfortable standard of living, but only if we invest wisely and manage our demand more sensibly  by reducing energy waste and improving efficiency.",416,582
"The Green Party would seek to cut energy demand by one-third by 2020,",416,583
one-half by 2030,416,584
and two-thirds by 2050.,416,585
The UK already has the technology it needs.,416,586
"What is lacking is the political will to build a cleaner, home-grown, more local, more affordable, more democratic and ultimately more reliable energy future.",416,587
Caroline Lucas and fuel poverty,503,588
"When joint chair of Parliaments cross-party group on ending fuel poverty and promoting energy efficiency, Green MP Caroline Lucas was a leading advocate of urgent action to end the scandal of cold homes.",503,589
She initiated a debate in Parliaments Westminster Hall about curbing the power of the Big Six energy companies,403,590
"and has asked parliamentary questions, lobbied ministers, spoken in debates and tabled amendments to legislation demanding action on warm homes and lower bills.",503,591
Caroline has campaigned for home energy efficiency to be made a UK National Infrastructure priority and to be given the necessary funding.,411,592
"She has stood up in Parliament for an Energy Bill revolution  the creation of the worlds most ambitious home energy-efficiency programme,",501,593
"which would slash energy bills and carbon emissions,",501,594
"create over 100,000 jobs",701,595
and help end the fuel poverty crisis once and for all.,403,596
Home energy improvement will be central to this drive to accelerate energy saving,501,597
while ensuring energy is affordable to all.,503,598
"We will: Provide a free nationwide retrofit insulation programme, concentrating on areas where fuel poverty is most serious.",503,599
This is designed to insulate 9 million homes in total,501,600
"and take at least 2 million homes out of fuel poverty,",503,601
aiming for the Passivhaus ultra low-energy refurbishment standard by 2020.,501,602
"It will offer up to £5,000 worth of free insulation, or other energy improvements such as solar photovoltaics (PV) if the insulation is already up to the standard, to every home in designated areas.",501,603
"To reach Passivhaus standards, there will be the option of up to a further £15,000 in subsidised loans from the Green Investment Bank for each dwelling for further improvements.",501,604
"This programme will invest £45 billion over the course of the Parliament (including investment in training and awareness), be delivered by local authorities",501,605
"and create well over 100,000 jobs.",701,606
It will become part of a new Green National Infrastructure programme.,501,607
"Give tenants the right to require landlords to achieve the same improvement to the energy performance of their home, and require all private rented sector housing to meet Energy Performance Band C by 2025.",501,608
Require all new homes to be built to the Passivhaus standard.,501,609
"Support this investment in insulating and building to Passivhaus standards with investment in training for the design and building industries, by creating a national college for training in energy home improvement,",501,610
"and building relationships with a network of affiliated facilities, including existing colleges and private training providers.",501,611
Invest too in energy awareness programmes so that people become as aware of the energy performance of their home (and of other buildings too) as they are now of the miles per gallon of their car.,501,612
Continue a fully funded Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.,501,613
Provide £4.5 billion over the Parliament to support research and development into less energy-intensive industrial processes.,411,614
"Prioritise public over private transport,",413,615
electrification of the transport system,411,616
and access over mobility.,503,617
"Give councils the power to insist that communal heating schemes, for example using waste heat from industrial sources, are implemented where practicable.",501,618
Establish mandatory standards for commercial building performance such as ISO 5001.,501,619
"Use carbon taxes (based on the present system) to fund investment in energy-efficiency measures,",501,620
and prepare for the following Parliament a carbon quota scheme to regulate the level of demand for energy.,501,621
Green councillors make home insulation happen...,501,622
"Work began last year in Stroud on a five-year £12 million programme planned by Green councillors Phillip Booth and Simon Pickering to improve the energy efficiency of over 1,000 homes in the district.",501,623
"New local jobs will be created for trades people to install insulation, solar panels and heat pumps.",701,624
"The four Greens on Kirklees Council secured three years of free home insulation funding, against the active opposition of Labour councillors, who later tried to claim credit!",501,625
This saved householders around £76 per year at 2011 prices,503,626
and cut emissions.,501,627
It also created 243 jobs in the local economy.,701,628
Carbon quotas  how they would work The fairest way to share emissions rights is equally.,503,629
"So we support the idea of an economy-wide system of carbon quotas, with everyone guaranteed the same basic entitlement, regardless of wealth.",503,630
"Those who use less than this could sell some of their quota to those who use more, rewarding their carbon thrift.",501,631
"About half the available carbon units could be distributed, free of charge, to all adults in the country.",503,632
The rest of the carbon units could be sold by the government to companies and other organisations.,501,633
Whenever you bought fossil fuels or electricity your carbon account card would be debited.,501,634
You would be able to sell excess carbon units  or buy extra units if you need to.,501,635
"Our vision for the energy system is a diverse mix of public and private participants, including community, cooperative and municipal generation, supply and distribution.",403,637
We will end the dominance of the Big Six energy companies.,403,638
"We will stabilise the policy landscape for renewable energy to provide certainty for investment decisions, including long-term targets and stable feedin tariffs.",403,639
"We will: Maximise opportunities for community or municipally owned, or cooperative not-for-profit organisations to generate and supply electricity and heat at the retail level.",403,640
Set a target for at least 42 gigawatts (GW) of community power by 2020.,403,641
Require grid operators to give priority access to community energy projects at an affordable cost.,412,642
Split up the large vertically integrated companies so that they cant both produce energy and supply it to consumers.,403,643
Secure public control over the strategic direction and policies of the National Grid.,413,644
Support long-term stable fixed-price feed-in tariffs for renewable energy generators.,412,645
"Ensure that consumer energy tariffs are progressive, so small consumers pay less per unit than larger ones,",403,646
"that special needs are recognised,",503,647
"that people are not cut off when they cant afford to pay,",503,648
and that people are not forced to have prepayment meters.,503,649
"Ensure that there is a single scheme of regulation for the entire industry,",403,650
whose objectives include achieving climate change targets,501,651
as well as protecting consumer interests.,403,652
Why we say no to fracking,416,653
"Fracking is a process where water, sand and chemicals are injected at high pressure into shale rocks under the ground to release shale gas or oil.",416,654
Three years ago we called for a moratorium on fracking-related activity while the environmental and economic impacts of drilling for shale gas were evaluated.,416,655
"On that basis, we are now emphatic and unambiguous in proposing an outright ban on fracking and related extreme energy technologies (coal-bed methane and underground coal gasification, as well as hydraulic fracturing).",416,656
Fracking is incompatible with the UKs climate change obligations.,416,657
There is already around five times more fossil fuel globally than we can safely burn if are to avoid dangerous climate change.,501,658
Encouraging a whole new fossil fuel industry is deeply irresponsible and undermines international efforts to secure a global climate agreement.,416,659
Fracking will put communities and our environment at risk.,416,660
"There are serious and legitimate concerns about the potential for fracking to cause water contamination, air pollution and harm to wildlife and public health.",416,661
"Fracking sites would entail mass lorry movements, blighting our countryside and villages.",416,662
The Green Party strategy for energy efficiency ensures that we can change to an energy system based mainly on electricity from renewables within 1520 years (a little longer for transport).,416,664
This will require substantial investment over the period.,416,665
We also need to pay more attention to energy storage.,416,666
"So we will: Invest substantial amounts of public money (up to £35 billion over the Parliament) in renewable generation and in the National Grid, if necessary, to make sure renewable generation grows quickly enough.",416,667
This would include both large-scale generation and small- and medium-scale renewable generation schemes funded through local authorities.,416,668
This capacity would not necessarily be publicly owned and would include community-owned schemes.,416,669
Give the Green Investment Bank full borrowing powers to help fund this investment.,501,670
Concentrate on expanding mature renewable technologies such as wind energy and solar PV in the period until 2030,501,671
"and bringing down costs, in part by reducing planning constraints, including those for onshore wind.",501,672
"Ensure that all schools, hospitals and other public buildings have solar panels by 2020.",501,673
"Encourage all social landlords to develop plans to install solar panels on all suitable properties, building on Kirklees Councils pioneering £10 million plan to install solar panels on 2,000 Council homes over the next two years.",501,674
Schemes such as these can save people on low incomes the equivalent of up to two weeks rent.,503,675
"Set deployment targets to bring down costs and attract investment in manufacturing and supply chains,",402,676
aiming for 42 GW of offshore wind by 2020,501,677
"and 60 GW by 2030,",501,678
and for 25 GW of solar PV by 2020.,501,679
"Spend £2.5 billion over the Parliament on an intensive research and deployment programme for other renewables such as wave and tidal stream generators or other approaches,",501,680
and also for storage technologies.,501,681
"Phase out fossil-fuel-based generation, including the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2023 at the very latest.",501,682
Phase out nuclear power within ten years.,501,683
Ban all UK fracking operations  following a growing number of nations worldwide  and withdraw all relevant licences as soon as possible.,416,684
Ban other new fossil fuel developments such as other unconventional fossil fuels and open cast coal.,416,685
"End fossil fuel industry tax breaks, phase out other harmful fossil fuel subsidies (domestic and international) and use the money saved to help fund other parts of our energy programme.",416,686
"Work with financial institutions, local councils and others to encourage divestment from fossil fuels and develop alternative investment in efficiency and renewables programmes.",416,687
Support the potential deployment of carbon capture and storage to existing biomass and gas power stations only as a transitional technology.,416,688
Develop biomass generation only where it can be done in a sustainable way giving regard to the environmental and human costs of some large-scale biomass fuel operations.,416,689
Set in law a decarbonisation target for the power sector of 2550 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030.,501,690
"Expand electricity storage capacity, including using the potential storage capacity of electric vehicles, and develop the commercial and regulatory framework to make this a reality.",501,691
Introduce smart meters and appliances.,416,692
"Apart from rebuilding the UKs energy system, we also need to adapt to the climate change that will take place as the effects of past emissions work their way through the system.",501,694
In the UK there will be wetter winters and hotter and drier summers.,501,695
"We can expect greater instability, with more episodes of extreme weather, such as the heavy rain and floods of the 201314 winter.",501,696
We need to begin urgently to prepare for this by: Providing help for people and communities to prepare for an increasingly variable climate.,501,697
We would give an extra £1 billion a year to local authorities and the Environment Agency to spend on assisting communities with flood protection,501,698
"and on defending homes and public buildings, such as hospitals, from heat waves.",501,699
Obliging government departments and local authorities to consider climate change and carbon reduction in all their planning over a long time horizon of 50100 years.,501,700
"Specifically, local authorities should do so in all planning decisions.",501,701
Having the government act as an insurer of last resort where commercial insurance companies are refusing to provide flood cover.,501,702
Preventing new building on flood plains.,501,703
"Encouraging storing water in uplands through full river system management  including wetland restoration, natural regeneration, allowing rivers to meander and allowing flooding upstream.",501,704
Water management needs to become part of the rules for farming subsidies.,501,705
"Green councillor sets the pace on flooding.. Thanks to a lone Green councillor, who at the time held the balance of power, Islington became the first UK Council to set a minimum amount of permeable land to prevent flooding.",501,706
Nuclear energy  its still no thanks,416,707
"In recent years, the nuclear industry has tried to re-brand itself as green.",416,708
"As the UKs only environmental party, the Green Party needs to set out why it still considers that nuclear is no answer to either climate change or our energy needs.",416,709
Nuclear energy is not green.,416,710
"Uncertainties involved in carbon costing, radioactive waste management and the carbon costs of obtaining uranium mean that the carbon costs of nuclear are unknowable.",416,712
"Unlike renewables, we simply cannot rely on it being low carbon.",416,713
"In addition to its highly dubious low-carbon credentials, nuclear energy is a seriously flawed policy in other ways:",416,714
"Nuclear energy is extremely expensive: not one nuclear plant has ever been built, anywhere in the world by private investors without huge public subsidies.",416,715
"The Coalition government has agreed to guarantee EDF nearly double the current market electricity price at Hinkley, in addition to other financial backing not available to other low-carbon generators.",416,716
These subsidies would impose enormous and unjustifiable costs on householders and businesses.,416,717
Nuclear remains a uniquely dangerous form of energy.,416,718
"If the new plant being built by EDF at Hinkley were to release an equivalent amount of radiation to Fukushima, and the wind was in the south-west, Bristol would need to be permanently evacuated.",416,719
No long-term solution has yet been found to the question of dealing with nuclear waste.,416,720
"Wind power has been found to create around 12 times as many jobs as the same investment in nuclear, and solar power is estimated to create around 360 times as many jobs.",501,721
Investing in energy efficiency (e.g. insulation) creates even more jobs.,501,722
Renewables can provide the same base load production as nuclear power at a lower cost without the risks.,416,723
"Nuclear power diverts investment, skills and expertise away from securing the economic, employment and energy security benefits of home-grown renewables, smart grids and demand reduction.",416,724
"The current UK nuclear programme is planned around a reactor design, the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR), which has an atrocious construction and cost record.",416,725
EPRs being built in France and Finland are years behind schedule and have huge cost overruns.,416,726
"Even if nuclear were the answer, the EPR would still be the wrong plant to build.",416,727
More equal societies almost always do better than unequal ones  and thats true for the well-off as well as for the poor.,503,729
"Almost every modern social and environmental problem  ill health, lack of community life, violence, drugs, obesity, mental illness, long working hours, big prison populations  is more likely to occur in a less equal society.",503,730
"Imagine a world in which everyone is respected whatever their ethnicity, gender, age, religious belief or non-belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, class, size, disability or other status.",503,731
Imagine a world in which no one earns more than ten times what anyone else earns.,503,732
"Wed all be healthier, happier and more confident.",503,733
This could be the real world the Green Party creates.,503,734
"The Green Party is opposed to inequality not just because it is wrong in itself and because more equal societies are happier societies,",503,735
but because it fosters inappropriate growth.,416,736
We are encouraged to measure our prosperity by comparing it with the material conditions of others.,416,737
Celebrity culture and the lifestyles of the rich create a climate of envy and a desire to match them.,416,738
This fuels consumption that satisfies pointless wants for some rather than vital needs for all.,416,739
Growth justifies inequality.,416,740
It is claimed that: if the economy gets bigger some benefit will trickle down to the poor and vulnerable;,416,741
A rising tide floats all boats  forgetting that not everyone has a boat.,416,742
"However, recent research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) confirms that this theory is just wrong.",416,743
"In a resource-constrained world, equality makes much more sense than inequality.",503,744
"Our taxation, pay and social security plans will make the UK a materially more equal society.",503,745
Equality is a matter not just of material goods but of treating people fairly  celebrating diversity rather than punishing it.,503,747
The Green Party aims to treat everyone equally and fairly.,503,748
We will: Reinstate the funding for the Equality and Human Rights Commission.,201,749
"Make equality and diversity lessons mandatory in all schools, from the first year of primary education onwards, to combat all forms of prejudice and bullying,",503,750
to promote understanding and acceptance of difference,503,751
and to ensure community cohesion.,606,752
Continue to tackle institutional racism in the police force and the wider criminal justice system.,503,753
"Require all police forces to have equality and diversity liaison officers whose remit is to tackle and take preventive action on crimes originating in discrimination against any group,",503,754
and to treat crimes arising from such discrimination on a par with racist crimes.,503,755
"Implement a UK-wide strategy to tackle violence against women, including domestic violence,",503,756
"rape and sexual abuse,",503,757
female genital mutilation,503,758
and trafficking.,503,759
Ensure that effective action is taken to prevent discrimination against people with disabilities.,503,760
Provide comprehensive training for teachers and educational staff on all diversity and inclusion issues.,503,761
Oblige schools to promote equal opportunities in their anti-bullying procedures and to monitor equality issues in teaching recruitment.,503,762
"Work towards ending stigma against people with mental health problems, including discrimination in employment.",503,763
Progressively introduce anonymised CVs so that Black and Minority Ethnic and female candidates are not excluded before the interview stage because of their identity.,503,764
Ensure that the public sector does more to employ more Black and Minority Ethnic employees.,503,765
Strengthen Travellers rights to sites and guarantee proper protection of the nomadic lifestyle of Travellers,503,766
while ensuring that the lifestyle of the settled population is also protected.,503,767
Enforce penalties against employers who continue to implement unequal pay.,605,768
Work vigorously towards ensuring that all levels of government and public bodies are representative of the diversity of the populations for whom they work.,503,769
Support proposals by the Speaker of the House of Common to set up an Equalities Committee.,503,770
Greens in power carry out our policies,501,771
Stonewall put the Green-led Brighton Council in first place in their 2014 Education Equality Index.,503,772
"Stonewall has described the Council as leading the way in celebrating difference and supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.",503,773
"Brighton Council also introduced the landmark trans scrutiny panel, looking how to address transphobia in the city.",503,774
"Of the 37 initial recommendations, 25 have started or been implemented, including addressing transphobia in schools,",503,775
allowing genderless honorifics for Council documentation,503,776
and easing access to healthcare for trans people.,503,777
"Despite recent modest advances, discrimination against LGBTIQ people remains in areas such as housing, education, employment and health.",503,779
"The Green Party supports campaigns to advance LGBTIQ rights and aims to build a society where everyone is valued, respected and empowered, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity.",503,780
We will: Legislate to remedy inequality in pension inheritance for same-sex marriage partners and same-sex civil partners.,503,781
"Consider reducing the 12-month blood donation deferral period for men who have sex with men, based on individual risk assessment where the donor is identified to be not at risk of passing infections into the blood supply.",503,782
"Apologise to and pardon all 50,000100,000 men convicted of consenting adult same-sex relations under anti-gay laws that have now been repealed.",503,783
"Provide mandatory HIV, sex and relationship education  age appropriate and LGBTIQ inclusive  in all schools from primary level onwards.",503,784
"Require every school to have an anti-bullying programme that explicitly combats homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying.",503,785
"Combat homophobic, biphobic and transphobic violence by ensuring uniform legislation against all forms of hate crime.",605,786
"End the cuts to the NHS, which have undermined HIV services and made it harder for trans people to access gender reassignment services.",503,787
End the detention of LGBTIQ (and other) asylum seekers and the culture of disbelief that often denies them refugee status.,503,788
"Challenge criminalisation, discrimination and violence against LGBTIQ people in other countries and work in solidarity with campaigners there.",503,789
Press the Commonwealth to grant accredited status to a Commonwealth LGBTIQ Association and to urge all member states to end the criminalisation of homosexuality and to protect LGBTIQ citizens against discrimination and hate crime.,503,790
Joining up the policies Anti-discrimination policies on their own arent enough.,503,791
Its vital to see the connections between one policy decision and its effects elsewhere in society.,503,792
"Cuts and austerity measures have a disproportionate effect on LGBTIQ people because of higher levels of reliance on public services due to family estrangement, societal and workplace discrimination, and specific healthcare needs.",503,793
"Likewise, cuts in youth, housing and social services are more likely to affect young LGBTIQ people, particularly those who are estranged from their families.",503,794
LGBTIQ people are more likely to face unemployment and the impact of this can be much greater because they may not be able to rely on wider social networks.,503,795
"Cuts to services for older and disabled people will have a much greater impact on LGBTIQ people, who are less likely to have children and will be more reliant on public services.",503,796
"So, restoring the public realm contributes to equality and diversity.",503,797
"Since 2010, recent progress in advancing womens equality has been undermined and reversed",503,799
Women are now: Poorer  nearly three-quarters of the governments savings have been paid for by women;,503,800
"Earning less  the value of low pay in particular is declining, and the pay gap between men and women in their twenties has doubled;",503,801
"Over-burdened  as support services have been slashed, women are left carrying the load;",503,802
and More at risk of gendered violence  because funding for services that support survivors of sexual and domestic violence has been reduced.,503,803
This is all a consequence of deliberate government action.,503,804
"The Public Sector Equality Duty, which assesses the impact of gove ivered, is designed to solve problems in isolation  the lack of a job or of a place to live, an illness  but problems usually arise together.",305,805
"An alternative approach, based on Womens Centres, has shown the potential to break down barriers and provide an effective holistic approach that facilitates resilience and recovery for women and their families.",305,806
"The Green Party would fund the creation of a nationwide set of pilots, and if their early promise turns out to be fulfilled would intend expanding this to a universal nationwide scheme, run in the voluntary sector by women but given secure long-term core funding through local government.",305,807
We will also: Make equal pay for men and women a reality.,503,808
Require 40% of all members of public company and public sector boards to be women.,503,809
Listen to girls and young women about relationships education and about sexism in the media,503,810
"and make personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) a compulsory part of the school curriculum.",506,811
"Take steps to tackle media sexism, starting with working with retailers to stop lads mags and other pornography from being sold in supermarkets and newsagents.",503,812
Ensure that the laws to prevent discrimination against women on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity are properly enforced.,503,813
Follow Scotlands lead and make it illegal to stop nursing mothers feeding their babies in a public place.,503,814
"Instead of helping disadvantaged people, the Coalition has scapegoated and isolated them.",503,817
Private firms assess people on the verge of death as fit for work.,503,818
The bedroom tax plays havoc with any person who is disabled and needs an extra room for equipment or a carer.,503,819
"Austerity has brought cuts to disability benefits, harming the most vulnerable in our society.",503,820
The Green Party is committed to the social model of disability.,503,821
People who are disabled have a right to participate fully in society.,503,822
"We will: Support the principles of, and enforce the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.",503,823
End the pernicious system whereby an external contractor assesses whether people are fit for work and return to the system of relying on the judgement of GPs or other health professionals.,504,824
Increase the budget for Disability Living Allowance / Personal Independence Payments by around £1 billion a year.,504,825
"Retain the Independent Living Fund, which enables over 18,000 severely disabled people to stay in their home instead of being in residential care, costing around £300 million a year.",504,826
Provide a further £0.5 billion for free social care for adults aged 1865 who have a proven care need.,504,827
"Increase the Carers Allowance by 50%, costing £1.2 billion a year (6.5 million carers save the state £119 billion),",504,828
and provide carers with a legal right to 510 days paid annual leave.,504,829
"Raise the profile of the Access to Work scheme among smaller firms and under-served disabled people, with far great transparency over how the scheme is administered.",503,830
Provide older carers with more generous and consistent support through a Citizens Pension.,504,831
Integrate health and care services so as to look after carers as well as those they care for.,504,832
"Recognise the rights of children who are disabled, and their families, in education, in the transition to adult life, in childcare, in healthcare and in the benefits system.",503,833
"Recognise fully the housing needs of people who are disabled, including support with planning and obtaining housing.",503,834
Make it a licensing condition for taxis that drivers have Disability Awareness Training.,503,835
Young people face very practical immediate problems with getting a good start in life.,503,837
"Decent jobs, jobs with a future and training, are hard to come by.",503,838
"The lucky few can get an internship or take advantage of good connections, but overall social mobility is in reverse.",503,839
"You can go to university, but only if you are prepared to saddle yourself with a huge debt.",503,840
Affordable housing is scarce.,503,841
And threats such as climate change,501,842
and ever-rising levels of inequality will have a far greater impact on future generations.,503,843
Young people must be supported outside school as well as in it; online and offline.,503,844
"They need places they can call their own, where they can safely play and explore.",503,845
"This means playgroups for toddlers, safe streets for kids to play in, and youth centres for teenagers.",503,846
"The Green Party would: Ensure that the UKs child protection systems are effective at tackling child neglect and abuse early on,",504,847
including changing the law so that emotional abuse is treated on a par with physical abuse,503,848
and giving police and child protection professionals clear guidance to help them work effectively.,503,849
"Set clear targets for ending child poverty, including ways to measure it and fund local authorities properly so they can focus on early support to help children, young people and their families.",503,850
"Increase the current investment in young peoples services, providing a comprehensive and inclusive youth service, including youth clubs, youth councils and non-curricular education and training, costing an extra £1.1 billion a year.",503,851
"Extend free local public transport to young people and students, spending up to £4 billion a year.",504,853
"`This would encourage the habit of using public transport among young people early on, with a view to making this a behaviour for life.",501,854
"Support 20 mph zones, cycle schemes and public transport to make our streets safe and useful for young people.",501,856
Raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14.,503,857
Lower the voting age to 16.,202,858
"Restrict police use of random stop and search powers, which especially damage police relationships with young people.",503,860
Make higher education free and end the student loan system.,506,861
End the exploitation of interns; ensure no unpaid full-time internship lasts more than four weeks.,701,862
"Make renting affordable and possible again for young people through our housing policies, especially those on regulating the private rented sector and rents.",503,863
End the exploitation of young people in low-wage jobs through our living wage policy.,701,864
Keep Housing Benefit for under 25s.,504,865
"Do more for young people who have no family; a basic first step would be to pay foster carers a salary, costing about £0.9 billion a year.",504,866
"Provide access to suitable emergency accommodation for the 200,000 young people who go missing every year if they are unable to return home safely.",504,867
Support the right of young people all over Europe to go to other parts of the EU to work and broaden their experience.,108,868
Provide more training and work experience for young unemployed people through expanding apprenticeships;,701,869
"specifically, provide an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 1625 who do not have one and want one.",701,870
"What Green councillors do for young people out of school.. In 2012, Green councillor Simon Grover persuaded Tory-run St Albans, Hertfordshire, to pledge to provide a youth centre in the town in the next five years.",706,871
"In Malvern, Worcestershire, Green councillor John Raines led the campaign to allow the community to buy a Council-owned youth centre earmarked for demolition and housing development.",606,872
It is now thriving under community ownership.,606,873
Age used to be respected.,706,875
"Now theres the beginning of a backlash against older people, particularly the baby boomer generation approaching their seventies.",706,876
"Theyve had it easy, its said  secure jobs, final salary pensions, good health and a housing market that has rewarded them but made it almost impossible for todays young people to get housed.",706,877
"And, as a generation, they have despoiled the planet and their swelling numbers threaten to bankrupt our health and pension systems.",706,878
The real picture is more complex.,706,879
"There are huge inequalities between older people, and many have had difficult lives.",503,880
The free university education of the past was a privilege for a tiny group of people.,503,881
Many more working lives were totally disrupted by Margaret Thatchers assault on manufacturing industry in the 1980s  these older people bear the scars of industrial diseases and health inequalities.,503,882
Many older women in particular have lead lives confined by lack of opportunity.,503,883
The Green Partys policy for older people is simple.,706,884
"First they are people, and they have the same rights and hopes as everyone else.",503,885
"They should be treated fairly and equally in employment, education, healthcare and avenues for enterprise.",503,886
Ambition should not be shut off just because we get older.,503,887
"Second, there are certain things they should be able to rely on without the indignity of means testing.",504,888
The most basic is a universal state pension.,504,889
"We would introduce a Citizens Pension, paid to all pensioners regardless of contribution record from 2016, so no pensioner will live in poverty.",504,890
"It will pay £180 per week to a single pensioner and £310 per week for a couple, taking all pensioners above the poverty line.",504,891
Future increases will be at the higher of the price increases of basic goods and services or average earnings.,504,892
The failure of private pensions  making pensions secure Private pension schemes have failed.,504,893
The £40 billion government subsidy given to private pension schemes in the form of income tax and National Insurance reliefs is huge.,504,894
The performance of the private pensions industry is dismal  the total paid out in private pensions each year is no more than the subsidy that the government gives the industry.,504,895
We will begin to reform this.,504,896
We would raise part of the money needed for the Citizens Pension by abolishing about half of the value of these concessions; the money is better invested in a better pension for all.,504,897
"We would further limit the amount of relief an individual can get on contributions in any one year, so that more of the subsidy goes to the lower paid.",504,898
"We would make saving for retirement safe and predictable, by offering a new state earnings-related pension scheme.",504,899
"This would invest through the Green Investment Bank in long-term public assets such as the railways, renewable energy and the National Grid, social and affordable housing, projects sponsored by local authorities, and public facilities such as hospitals.",501,900
"These assets offer a safe, long-term and predictable rate of return  ideal for pensions  and the pension fund will provide the savings needed to invest in these assets.",504,901
"Such public assets would replace pension fund assets, many of which consist of shares in energy companies whose main assets are unusable fossil fuel reserves.",501,902
"Employers would be obliged to offer and contribute to this pension scheme, as they are now with stakeholder pensions;",504,903
"the default would be for employees to be contracted in to the scheme, and a persons contributions would be unaffected by changes of employer.",504,904
In addition we will: Provide free social care funded by taxation on the same basis as the NHS.,504,905
Keep the pensioners bus pass and Winter Fuel Payment.,504,906
"Provide free prescriptions for all and abolish the TV licence, making the current concessions unnecessary.",504,907
Support enforcing the rights of older people through the Dignity Code.,503,908
Make sure that all pensioners living abroad receive the same pension and annual pension increase as those living in the UK.,504,909
"Support 20 mph zones, cycle schemes and public transport to make our streets safe and useful for older as well as young people.",501,910
"Keep the NHS a public service, comprehensive and free at the point of delivery,",504,911
especially recognising that the current generation of older people have paid for it all their lives and are now beginning to need it.,504,912
"As is traditional, we have listed here items that are specifically in the interests of older people.",706,913
"But we hope and believe that many older people will vote with their children and grandchildren in mind as much as themselves, and that they will in particular have in mind the long-term threats to our climate and environment.",501,914
"Green councillors look after older people...In 2012, Green councillor David Brookes was appointed the elderly peoples champion for Lancaster City Council and has persuaded the Council to advertise almshouse charity vacancies on its lettings site and to devote a web page to events and issues for the elderly.",503,915
"In Bradford, Greens secured £300,000 to fund free cavity wall and loft insulation for older residents.",503,916
"Joining up the policies So what do health, food, equality and transport have to do with each other?",501,917
"We all know that, to be healthy we need to eat well and take more exercise.",501,918
"So if we promote healthy eating, local food, good free school meals and active transport, we will be healthier.",501,919
"And if we are all more equal, not only will we be healthier but more of us will use public transport and standards will rise.",501,920
"And if as a result we are healthier, well be more inclined to get an allotment, walk to the bus stop and get a bus, reducing climate change-producing gases.",501,921
Its a virtuous circle.,501,922
Imagine a National Health Society.,504,924
"Imagine living in a clean environment, with satisfying work, good housing, a balanced diet, a good education, active, safe and sustainable transport, and much greater equality.",503,925
This is well-being  so vital to good health.,503,926
"Imagine being in no doubt that the health service is publicly funded, with free prescriptions, dentistry and chiropody; one in which you have a human relationship with your doctors and nurses, who make your care their principal aim.",504,927
"A health service in which individual and local knowledge take the place of protocols and pathways,",504,928
and free social and nursing care is provided for the elderly;,504,929
"one which prizes prompt and local access to care, and encourages a culture of prevention as well as cure.",504,930
"Imagine a system that respects and trusts health professionals and gives them the time, space, training and rewards to do their job.",504,931
This could be the real health service; it is the Green Partys joined-up approach to health and well-being.,504,932
The Green Party believes healthcare shouldnt be bought and sold.,413,934
"All the other parties have encouraged the marketisation and privatisation of provision and this has led to: Fragmentation of services, with patients falling into gaps between providers, and poor communication between clinicians;",413,935
"Outsourcing, with companies cutting corners to win contracts;",413,936
"Cherry-picking of profitable treatments by private providers, leaving the NHS to provide treatments that are not properly funded; and",413,937
An increase in administration costs of 9% of the NHS budget.,413,938
"We will maintain a publicly funded, publicly provided health service free at the point of use.",413,939
"Money spent on health will remain in the public economy, supporting the NHS rather than going into private companies profits.",413,940
"We will: Repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and introduce an NHS Reinstatement Bill restoring the obligation upon the government to provide a comprehensive health service,",413,941
"abolishing competition and the purchaserprovider split ,",413,942
"ending market-based commissioning and procurement,",413,943
"re-establishing public bodies,",413,944
a role for not-for-profit organisations,413,945
"and public accountability,",413,946
"restricting the role of commercial companies,",413,947
and repealing the right of the Secretary of State to close hospitals or departments without effective public participation.,202,948
Promote transparency by ending commercial confidentiality.,202,949
Carry out an investigation into the opaque system of patronage and lobbying that has characterised the privatisation of the NHS.,304,950
Require NHS staff to declare financial interests that conflict with their role.,304,951
Stop further private finance initiative (PFI) contracts and end the inappropriate sale of NHS assets.,413,952
"Seek ways to buy out existing PFI contracts where that would represent good value for money, and set aside up to £5 billion over the Parliament to do so.",413,953
Restore the public sector ethos of partnership between staff and patients.,413,954
Caroline Lucas opposing the Health and Social Care Act 2012 in Parliament:,413,955
"The Bill opens the way for private companies to determine much of English health care and takes away the governments duties and powers, which is why I believe it should be opposed.",413,956
Either we want an NHS free at the point of delivery and with free eye tests and so forth or we do not.,413,957
Caroline has since introduced the NHS Reinstatement Bill.,413,958
The Coalition government has not increased funding to keep up with inflation and increasing demand  indeed it has continued efficiency savings.,504,960
And money has been diverted into the cost of reorganisation and into profits for the private companies now running many services.,504,961
"The result is one in four people going to crowded A&E Departments because they could not see a GP quickly enough,",504,962
and a crisis in mental health care.,504,963
"International comparisons underline that we can spend more  we spend just 9.6% of GDP on health (including private healthcare), the French 11.7%, the Germans 11.5% and the USA an astonishing 17.6%.",504,964
"We would: Immediately increase the overall NHS budget by £12 billion a year to overcome the current funding crisis, increase investment in mental health care and provide for free dentistry, chiropody and prescriptions in England.",504,965
"Thereafter, increase the overall NHS budget annually in real terms by 1.2% to take account of our ageing population.",504,966
Together with the previous item this will raise NHS budgets by about £20 billion by 2020.,504,967
Increase alcohol and tobacco taxes to help fund the annual increases in NHS spending over the Parliament.,504,968
"Provide free social care as well as free healthcare for older people along the lines of the report from the Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care in England (Barker report), at an additional cost of around £8 billion a year initially but rising to £9 billion by the end of the Parliament.",504,969
"Provide free social care at the end of life, enabling dying people to choose where they die.",504,970
"We would also: Provide accessible, local community health centres that provide a wide range of services, including out-of-hours care.",504,971
These will help people access healthcare quickly rather than being a replacement for GPs.,504,972
End phony patient choice.,504,973
"For most of us patient choice is much less important than getting good treatment at our local hospital or health centre  which is often, for many, the only practical choice.",504,974
Listen to and work in partnership with third sector organisations that are championing patient care.,504,975
Ensure that all cost-effective treatments are available to all patients who need them.,504,976
Work to ensure that cancer outcomes in the UK are as good as the best in Europe.,504,977
"Build systems to measure and improve the ecological impact of healthcare, from carbon costings of treatments (building them into the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines),",501,978
"to setting targets on recycling in NHS Trusts,",501,979
and the issue of waste disposal.,501,980
A colossal amount of material waste is produced through the disposable culture that has taken hold in the fight against hospital-acquired infections.,501,981
"Green councillors support NHS dentistry...The market town of Stowmarket, Suffolk, became the first in the county to open a new NHS dentist surgery after a lengthy campaign by Green councillors.",504,982
The Green Party takes a whole society approach to health.,504,984
We care about what happens before you access the NHS.,504,985
"Get that right, and a lot else falls into place.",504,986
How to achieve this affects how we organise the health service.,504,987
"Those involved in primary and community care  GPs, practice nurses, district nurses, health visitors, midwives, counsellors, pharmacists, occupational therapists and all the other community based professionals  are best placed to prevent ill health from developing in the first place.",504,988
"They can carry out checks and give advice or treatment to people who, for instance, are stressed, obese, inactive, or alcohol or nicotine dependent.",504,989
Intervention by a trusted health professional can make the difference at an individual level.,504,990
"This can often be linked to local services, such as advice centres, opportunities for physical activity, lunch clubs and so on.",504,991
And its primary care that is most important in dealing with problems before they become acute and require costly and distressing interventions such as admission to hospital.,504,992
"Local health professionals can also manage chronic illnesses such as diabetes, respiratory and cardiac conditions and mental illness in ways that are both more patient centred and less expensive than hospitalbased care.",504,993
They are best placed too to integrate medical and social care.,504,994
"Where parents want it and there are no medical complications, normal childbirth could take place at home, increasing satisfaction for the woman in labour and reducing costs for the NHS.",504,995
"Similarly, many people would prefer to spend their last days at home rather than in hospital and a small increase in community care would save hospital beds and make the experience better for the dying patient, their family and friends.",504,996
We would therefore place more emphasis on prevention and on primary and community care and less on hospitals.,504,997
We would: Restore the proportion of NHS funding for primary care from the present 7% to 2005 levels (11%) and review the case for increasing it further;,504,998
we would also ensure that the distribution of funding reflects the local need.,504,999
Always consider whether services currently offered in or by hospitals could be transferred to the community.,504,1000
"Look for low-tech, local solutions as well as technical advances.",504,1001
"Encourage cooperation between all the primary care providers, e.g. pharmacies and hearing, optical and old age care organisations.",504,1002
"Tackle air pollution, which causes an estimated 29,000 premature deaths each year in the UK.",501,1003
"UK and EU standards on air pollution are out of date, and we would follow more rigorous standards that respect World Health Organization guidelines.",501,1004
"Give special attention to the well-being of children from conception to 2 years old, the first 1001 days.",503,1005
"For example, there should be national investment in evidence-based parenting programmes in order to improve the life chances of children and the well-being of families,",503,1006
and a free and universal early education and childcare service should be introduced.,504,1007
"Extend VAT at the standard rate to less healthy foods, including sugar, but spend the money raised on subsidising around one-third of the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables.",504,1008
"This could prevent around 5,000 premature deaths every year.",504,1009
Put a minimum price on alcohol of 50p per unit.,412,1010
"This will reduce the physical, psychological and social harm associated with problem drinking, and will have only a negligible impact on those who drink in moderation.",504,1011
"Put the UK at the centre of efforts to end the AIDS, TB and malaria epidemics and the threat they pose to the health of women, men and children living in poverty.",107,1012
"Treat drug addiction as a health problem rather than a crime, making drugs policy the responsibility of the Department of Health in order to ensure that resources are targeted at supporting, not punishing, drug users.",504,1013
"Adopt an evidence-based approach to the step-by-step regulation, starting with cannabis, of the drugs currently banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act as well as legal highs, with a view to introducing a system that reduces harms and brings the market under state control as a potential tax revenue generator.",403,1014
"A Royal Commission or similar body would be established to review currently controlled drug classifications, within a legalised environment of drug use.",403,1015
"Introduce a regime of presumed consent for organ donation, which respects the right of relatives to refuse consent.",201,1016
Provide the right to an assisted death within a rigorous framework of regulation and in the context of the availability of the highest level of palliative care.,201,1017
End mixed-sex accommodation in hospitals.,201,1018
Improve hospital food.,504,1019
"Green councillors will stand up to fast-food chains...After KFC applied to open a drive-through store close to a primary school in Solihull, Green councillor Andy Hodgson persuaded the Council to toughen up its planning rules to allow refusal of fast-food chains near schools.",501,1020
"The Green Party listens to knowledge and experience, not political dogma",305,1022
"The Green Party would: Place the quality of patient care, especially patient safety, at the heart of the system.",504,1031
Reducing costs would not be the primary driver of behaviour but would be the outcome of best practice.,504,1032
Evolve the best system of care with the help of the service providers.,504,1033
"Engage, empower and hear patients and carers at all times, treating both with dignity.",504,1034
"Foster whole-heartedly the growth, development and training of all staff, including their involvement in improving the systems in which they work.",504,1035
"Embrace transparency in the interests of sharing best practice, accountability and cooperation.",504,1036
"Use quantitative data to better understand how the system is working, not to set targets, and to see them as a route to continuously improving patient care, not an end in themselves.",504,1037
"Ensure that there are clear lines of responsibility, especially for safety and interdepartmental cooperation.",504,1038
Respect the NHS Pay Review Body and bring NHS pay back in line with inflation and negotiate improved conditions.,504,1039
Expand the workforce to drive the wholesale improvement of mental health services.,504,1040
"The extra funding proposed for the NHS and social care will create a total of 400,000 jobs.",504,1041
"There has been an alarming rise in mental health problems in recent years, especially among young people.",504,1043
"According to NHS England, mental illness accounts for 28% of illness but only 13% of NHS spending.",504,1044
"In the course of a year, one in four adults experiences some form of mental ill health",504,1045
If you have diabetes theres a 92% chance youll get treatment.,504,1046
"If you have a mental illness, that chance goes down to 28%.",504,1047
Around 70% of prisoners have two or more mental health conditions.,504,1048
The governments own Chief Medical Officer says mental health should be given greater priority.,504,1049
It will take time to train more staff and expand services but the Green Party will put an end to mental healths Cinderella status and achieve parity of esteem by 2020.,504,1050
We will: Ensure that spending on mental health care rises within our overall commitment to increase real spending on health.,504,1051
Ensure that no one waits more than 28 days for access to talking therapies.,504,1052
"Ensure that everyone experiencing a mental health crisis, including children and young people, should have safe and speedy access to quality care, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",504,1053
"The use of police cells as places of safety for children should be eliminated by 2016,",504,1054
and by the end of the next Parliament should only occur for adults in exceptional circumstances.,504,1055
"Ensure that everyone who requires a mental health bed should be able to access one in their local NHS Trust area, unless they need specialist care and treatment.",504,1056
"If specialist care is required, then this should be provided within a reasonable distance of where the patient lives.",504,1057
Implement a campaign to end the discrimination and stigma associated with mental health through supporting the Time for Change programme and offering employment support to those with mental health problems.,503,1058
"Invest in dementia services, ensuring that support is available for all affected by this debilitating disease, including families and carers.",504,1059

"Improve access to addiction services, including both drugs and alcohol addiction.",504,1066
Give higher priority to the physical healthcare of those with mental health problems.,504,1067
"Joining up the policies So what do mental health, drugs, crime and welfare have to do with each other?",504,1068
"Our current welfare system breeds desperation and stress, not security, causing mental health problems.",504,1069
Ending workfare and making work pay better will bring security and encourage better mental health.,504,1070
Mental health problems foster drug dependency and crime.,504,1071
"If we can improve mental health, drug use and crime rates will fall.",504,1072
"With lower drug use and crime, and a supportive welfare system, more people will find useful things to do, improving their mental health.",504,1073
Its another virtuous circle.,504,1074
"Imagine free universal early education and childcare, with compulsory education starting at 7.",506,1076
Smaller classes and free nutritious lunches.,506,1077
More opportunity for outdoor education.,506,1078

Apprenticeships for 1625 year olds who want them.,411,1082
The restoration of the Education Maintenance Allowance for 1617 year olds and the abolition of university tuition fees.,506,1083
Imagine schools and colleges fit for children and young adults,506,1084
"Education is good for each of us, but it is also good for all of us  its a common good.",506,1085
Thats why the Green Party will make education free for everyone up to and including university or equivalent.,506,1086
"Although the single most important factor for a childs development is the learning environment at home, high-quality pre-school education can make a big difference.",506,1088
"The government has focused on lower-quality childcare, which has little or no effect.",503,1089
"Moreover, disadvantaged children who attend settings with children from mixed social backgrounds make more progress than those in settings serving mainly disadvantaged children.",503,1090
"These findings are why we want to create a universal high-quality early years education system used by everyone, to give every child the best possible start.",503,1091
Great credit is due to the previous Labour government for its Sure Start childrens centres. But too many of these have closed as a result of austerity.,503,1092
"Although support for childcare has grown under the Coalition, the government provides scant support to parents in the first two years of a childs life, and too much of the emphasis for the next three years is on expanding free and subsidised childcare so that parents, especially women, can work.",506,1093
Too little attention is paid to the child and to the value of early education.,506,1094
"The Green Party proposes to extend the education system to provide a free, universal and flexible system of good-quality early education and support for parents from birth until the age of compulsory education.",506,1095
"We would: Build a free but voluntary universal early education and childcare service for all children from birth until compulsory education age, which we would raise to 7 years.",506,1096
"Integrate this into the local education service, run by local education authorities, and build on existing infant schools.",506,1097
Local authorities would be would be given freedom as to how to do so in the light of their local circumstances.,301,1098
"Ensure that the system includes childrens centres for the very youngest children and their parents, and childcare and early education for children from age .",506,1099
Ensure that those who lead early years education are qualified teachers with qualified teacher status and with specialist knowledge of early years education; and ensure all other staff are qualified to level 3.,506,1100
Encourage parents to participate in helping to run the service.,506,1101
Ensure that parents would receive much increased Child Benefit from 2016 and would continue to receive Statutory Maternity and Paternity Pay.,504,1102
"We estimate that in the longer run this will cost around £8 billion a year over and above the cost of the existing free and subsidised schemes and tax concessions, which would be abolished.",506,1103
Teachers feel undervalued and their professionalism is undermined by a strict curriculum.,506,1105
"Two-fifths of teachers quit within five years of beginning their careers, ground down by an excessive workload, much of it unrelated to teaching.",506,1106
The Green Party believes that children are over-assessed and teachers are over-regulated.,506,1107
"Teaching to the test is not satisfying teaching and its boring for students, yet thats what successive governments have obliged teachers to do.",506,1108
"We need to free teachers and pupils to rediscover the excitement of learning,",506,1109
"released from the shackles of a system designed with only economic competitiveness and preparation for work in mind,",506,1110
and with excessive teacher workloads burdened by bureaucracy.,506,1111
We are determined to make schools fit for children rather than the other way round.,506,1112
"In line with Green Party principles, decisions around education will be taken at the most local level possible,",301,1113
"but in general we support: Democratic accountability and a key role for local authorities in planning, admissions policy and equality of access for children with special needs.",301,1114
"A comprehensive system of local schools offering mixed-ability teaching and staffed by qualified teachers,",503,1115
and the integration of grammar schools into the comprehensive system.,503,1116
Restoring education current and capital funding to 2010 levels in real terms (costing around £7 billion a year),506,1117
"and distributing it fairly among local authorities, reflecting the core costs of education, pupil needs, the quality of existing school buildings and equity between school types.",503,1118
"With the new early education service above, and counting the expansion of apprenticeships below this, would create around a quarter of a million jobs.",701,1119
Action to reduce teacher workload and introduce professional pay levels for all teachers.,701,1120
Ending the marketisation and outsourcing of education.,413,1121
Leaving local education authorities free to decide how much to allocate to current spending and how much to capital projects.,301,1122

We will phase out public funding of schools run by religious organisations.,503,1132
"Schools may teach about religions, but should not encourage adherence to any particular religious beliefs.",503,1133
Home education and flexi-schooling.,506,1134
"Free nutritious lunches, with local and GM-free ingredients, and children involved in growing, preparing and cooking food where possible.",501,1135
"The number of infants eating school lunches since the current free meals were introduced has increased from just 300,000 to 1,640,530 now.",506,1136
The extension will cost an additional £2 billion a year.,506,1137
"Ensuring that all schools that serve particular vulnerable communities, for example the Jewish, Muslim or Sikh communities, are adequately protected from sectarian attacks.",503,1138
An end to the trend whereby parents have to buy as extras equipment needed at school or for participation on expensive school trips.,506,1139
"Caroline Lucas on personal, social, health and economic education",506,1140
"In Parliament, Green MP Caroline Lucas led on making sure that all young people get taught high-quality PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education).",506,1141
She introduced a Bill in Parliament to require all schools to teach the subject and for teachers to get proper training and support.,506,1142
Good PSHE is key to ending violence against women and girls,503,1143
and also has significant knock-on benefits for both academic attainment and future employability.,503,1144
We will: Oppose the privatisation of further education and return further education colleges to the democratic control of local government.,413,1147
"Reverse the trend whereby 45% of apprenticeships, that is, jobs with structured training, are now taken by people over 25.",503,1148
"We would reinstate the governments duty to provide an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 1619 who do not have one and want one, but extend it to age 25,",411,1149
and increase funding for apprenticeships by 30%.,411,1150
Restore the Education Maintenance Allowance for 16 and 17 year olds.,506,1151
Provide the further education sector with £1.5 billion a year extra funding.,506,1152
Connect universities with local schools and colleges through nationwide Widening Participation programmes.,506,1153
Encourage local authorities to use some of the additional money we propose to give to them to restore a full range of local adult education programmes.,506,1154
"End the anomaly whereby schools and academies can reclaim VAT on goods and services whereas sixth form colleges and further education colleges cannot, by allowing the latter to claim, costing around £170 million a year.",503,1155
Prioritise training in the skills needed to build a low-carbon economy.,501,1156
Greens in power carry out our policies,501,1157
"Education in Brighton & Hove was for long a major concern to parents in the city, but since the Greens came to office results have improved.",305,1158
"The 2013 GCSE results were the best ever, though they fell in 2014 after tougher marking was introduced across the country.",305,1159
A level results continued to improve in 2014.,305,1160
And 80% of sixth forms and colleges are good or outstanding as judged by Ofsted.,305,1161
Higher education is in crisis.,506,1163
"The fundamental purpose of universities should be to promote critical enquiry, social innovation and cultural renewal.",506,1164
But these aims have been sidelined in an atmosphere of increasing managerialism and commercialisation.,506,1165
Higher education is vital to our cultural health.,502,1166
"It should be concerned with public engagement and increasing social participation, not considered merely a production line for enhancing the earning power of individuals.",502,1167
The current focus on research outputs in the narrow definition used by the Research Excellence Framework  means that the crucial role of lecturers as teachers has been denigrated.,506,1168
This emphasis needs to be reversed.,506,1169
"The Conservative-led Coalition and the Labour Party bear responsibility for the current system of university funding, which is largely dependent on tuition fees that now stand at £9,000 a year for undergraduates.",506,1170
"This was a betrayal of a promise and has blighted the future of thousands of young people who now graduate with a debt of at least £45,000.",506,1171
"With the removal of public funding from most undergraduate and all postgraduate courses, UK universities are now all but privatised.",413,1172
"The only people to benefit from the current system are university Vice-Chancellors and senior bureaucrats, who award themselves massive pay rises, while those on the ground who carry out teaching and research face ever more punishing terms and conditions of employment.",503,1173
"In practice, this severely compromises the quality of education through reduced student-contact hours with overstretched staff.",506,1174
"Zero-hours contracts are now commonplace and shocking disparities in pay characterise every campus, especially among service workers, who are commonly denied a living wage.",701,1175
"Conversely, university administrative departments continue to swell as money is routinely wasted on copying expensive private sector practices  including ludicrous rebranding exercises  in search of market share.",413,1176
"The future of the arts and the humanities has been endangered by a systematic denigration by the dominant political parties and university administrations alike, who create a perception of such courses as an expensive luxury without the vocational use-value that renders them worth the financial risk.",502,1177
"The Green Party believes that the arts and humanities have an essential part to play in creating a more democratic, sane and participatory society.",502,1178
The situation for mature students is even more dire.,506,1179
"Over the past five years, every continuing education department in the UK has been scaled back or closed down altogether, often as a managerial response to caps on students numbers and diminished funding for the sector as a whole.",506,1180
Adults wishing to return to education are faced with a situation where short courses and part-time study are considered not cost-effective in market terms.,506,1181
"In December 2010, just after the trebling of tuition fees, Caroline Lucas MP argued that the costs of a free higher education could be met by increasing corporation tax for larger companies to the level paid in other G7 countries and ring-fencing some of that money.",506,1182
"Businesses depend enormously on graduates skills and knowledge, so its only fair that they invest in the higher education system from which they benefit.",503,1183
"Allied to this, the cost of studying the qualifications that universities stipulate as entry requirements is prohibitive.",506,1184
An A level for those who are not registered as school or college students attracts a fee of several hundred pounds.,506,1185
"Access to education diplomas are also meshed within a loan system for those over the age of 24, and uniformly cost in excess of £3,000.",506,1186
"The part-time and short courses for which non-traditional applicants can enrol are often hugely expensive, especially when measured against the contact-time with lecturers.",506,1187
Lifelong Learning is a phrase that is much used by politicians and education professionals.,506,1188
Giving people the opportunity to be second chance learners should be a crucial part of what universities offer to wider society.,506,1189
Countering the monetisation of higher education across the entire sector is vital to reverse the destructive and wasteful market model of university education.,413,1190
The Green Party would address this through: Ending undergraduate tuition fees.,506,1191
We appreciate that the current level of applications to study at university reflects the paucity of other opportunities available to young people.,503,1192
This is part of a wider social problem that must be tackled,503,1193
To be saddled with a huge debt for the right to access higher education at the beginning or middle of adulthood is neither ethical nor sustainable.,506,1194
"Because of the way the student loans system works this would cost about £4.5 billion over this Parliament, and in the long run around £8 billion a year.",506,1195
Cancelling student debt issued by the Student Loans Company and held by the government.,506,1196
"Taking account of the loans that it is expected would never be re-paid, the total value of these loans is estimated to be around £30 billion.",506,1197
"Assuming that these loans would be paid off over the next 25 years, and taking account of interest, this amounts to around £2.2 billion a year in revenue that the government would not receive.",506,1198
Reintroducing student grants costing £2.2 billion over the Parliament.,506,1199
In the longer run we would support student living costs through the Basic Income.,504,1200
"In the longer term, considering scrapping fees for academic postgraduate courses.",506,1201
Restoring access to lifelong learning by supporting mature students and their families.,503,1202
We will reverse the 20-year programme of dismantling the lifelong learning sector.,506,1203
Reintroducing the block grant to universities.,506,1204
It is essential that teaching and learning can be supported effectively across the sciences and the humanities.,506,1205
Encouraging universities and pension funds such as the Universities Superannuation Scheme to divest from fossil fuel companies.,501,1206
This would follow the example of the University of Glasgow.,501,1207
Supporting the 10:1 fair pay campus campaign.,503,1208
"We are committed to ending the scandal of Vice-Chancellors paying themselves £300,000 a year while cleaners on the national minimum wage have to resort to food banks.",503,1209
Green councillors support apprenticeships...Greens in Brighton have made it standard practice for apprenticeships and training schemes to be included in all Council construction contracts.,411,1210
Want to rent? Want to buy? Struggling to do either? It doesnt have to be this way.,504,1212
"The Green Party has policies to make housing affordable and sustainable,",504,1213
"to make sure there is enough to go round,",504,1214
and to provide better quality and greater security in the private rented sector.,504,1215
A secure and affordable place to live is one of our most basic human needs.,504,1216
But houses and flats are now sites of speculation rather than simply somewhere to call home.,504,1217
"They were at the heart of the crash seven years ago, when reckless lending left banks unable to support themselves.",504,1218
We need to return housing to its original purpose: providing us  each and every one of us  with affordable and sustainable shelter.,504,1219
"There are three reasons for the current chaos and unfairness: A misplaced faith in the market as the way to meet housing needs,",504,1220
"where the market for houses has too often reflected a desire to make an investment rather than buy a place to live,",504,1221
and prices have risen faster than inflation;,504,1222
"A lack of investment in public housing for at least 20 years, following Right to Buy and restrictions on what local authorities can do;",504,1223
and A private rented sector where too often people have insecurity of tenure and are being charged extortionate rents for unsatisfactory housing.,504,1224
"Caroline Lucas and housing In July 2014 Caroline Lucas MP introduced a Housing (Affordability, Supply and Tenant Protection) Bill to highlight the problems faced by private tenants.",504,1225
"The Bill required the Secretary of State to commission a programme of research into reducing rent levels in the private rented sector,",403,1226
"improving terms and conditions for tenants,",403,1227
"increasing housing supply,",408,1228
and providing a large-scale programme of sustainable council housing in England.,504,1229
"House prices continue to rise quicker than wages and inflation, and first-time buyers find it almost impossible to buy a home.",403,1235
"If wages had gone up by as much as house prices since 1997, the average person would be earning almost £30,000 more a year.",403,1236
When house prices crash there are consequences for the whole economy.,403,1237
The Green Party will aim for house price stability by making property investment and speculation less attractive and by increasing housing supply.,408,1238
We will: Give the Bank of England the powers it has requested to limit the size of mortgages in relation to the property value and the borrowers income.,403,1239
"Take steps to ensure that development is more evenly distributed across the whole of the country, so reducing pressure on housing in the South East in particular.",408,1240
"Make buy to let less attractive, so reducing pressure on house prices, by removing tax incentives, including the deduction of mortgage interest as an expense, and reforming the wear and tear allowance.",403,1241
"Introduce new higher Council Tax bands for more expensive homes, with higher rates for empty homes.",403,1242
"Scrap the governments Help to Buy scheme, which does nothing to help those in the greatest housing need and contributes to excessive demand, saving £600 million a year.",504,1243
Take action on empty homes to bring them back into use.,408,1244
"There are about 700,000 empty homes.",408,1245
Halve this number through Empty Property Use Orders.,408,1246
Gradually phase out Stamp Duty Land Tax and consider a Land Value Tax.,408,1247
Minimise encroachment onto undeveloped greenfield sites wherever possible by reusing previously developed sites that have fallen into disuse.,416,1248
"Reduce VAT on housing renovation and repair work (including insulation) to 5%, costing £1.6 billion a year.",416,1249
At present there is no VAT on constructing new dwellings but there is VAT at 20% on converting and renovating old buildings to be used as homes.,416,1250
This encourages new building at the expense of saving land and using what we have.,416,1251
Introduce the right to rent (where local councils step in to help those in difficulty with their mortgage to rent their home).,504,1252
Onethird of mortgage borrowers are expected to struggle if interest rates increase by 2%.,403,1253
Break up the big builder cartels and diversify the house-building industry so that more homes are built by small- and medium-sized builders and by community-led and cooperative initiatives.,403,1254
"In the short term we would achieve this by measures including bringing transparency to the land market,",403,1255
"the transfer of public land into community land trusts,",403,1256
and parcelling big regeneration sites into smaller plots through the Custom Build model.,403,1257
Successive governments affordable and social housing policies have failed.,504,1259
There is not enough housing for those unable to afford either to buy or to pay market rents.,504,1260
"The time has come to reverse the decline of council housing, started by the Right to Buy.",504,1261
"We would: Provide 500,000 social rented homes to high sustainability standards by increasing the social housing budget from £1.5 billion a year to £6 billion a year in the lifetime of the Parliament,",504,1262
"removing borrowing caps from local councils,",504,1263
"and creating 35,000 jobs.",701,1264
"Devolve Housing Benefit budgets to councils, so they can design packages that improve access to housing in their local market and enable them to provide more council housing.",504,1265
End mass council house sales and the Right to Buy at a discounted price.,504,1266
"Provide more rights for homeless people, giving local authorities the same duties with regard to single people and childless couples as to families, and ending the practice of declaring people intentionally homeless.",504,1267
"Aim to end rough sleeping completely, and give public authorities a duty to prevent it.",504,1268
Oppose new arms length management organisations and ensure genuine tenant participation in existing ones.,403,1269
Greens in power carry out our housing policies,504,1270
In Green-led Brighton: In November 2012 Brighton Council introduced a new licensing scheme by which private landlords letting a property for sharing by three or more people must bring it up to an agreed standard.,403,1271
"More than 1,500 licences were applied for by April 2014.",403,1272
By July 2014 the Green-led Council had brought some 416 council homes and more than 460 empty private homes back into use.,504,1273
By November 2014 Greens had overseen the delivery of 389 affordable homes (as part of wider residential and mixed developments).,408,1274
Another 130 are due to be completed before May 2015.,408,1275
In the Green Partys term of administration it will have overseen the building of 639 homes.,408,1276
"A further 681 affordable homes, including more than 200 new council homes, are in the development pipeline.",504,1277
"For the first time in living memory, communal heating bills in some Brighton & Hove Council blocks have fallen as Council tenants benefit from a major programme of energy efficiency retro-fitting.",504,1278
There is a place for a private rented sector.,403,1280
But experience shows that it needs to be well regulated and the difference in power between landlord and tenant corrected.,403,1281
"We would: Reform the private rented sector by introducing a living rent tenancy (including five-year fixed tenancy agreements),",403,1282
"smart rent control that caps annual rent increases linked to the Consumer Price Index,",403,1283
"security of tenancy and local not-for-profit letting agencies,",403,1284
and abolishing letting agents fees and insurance-based deposit schemes.,403,1285
Set up a Living Rent Commission to explore whether controls could bring rents more in line with local average incomes.,403,1286
Introduce a mandatory licensing scheme for landlords.,403,1287
"Abolish landlord perks, such as tax deductions against a variety of expenditures, including mortgage interest relief.",403,1288
Ending mortgage interest tax relief alone will raise £5.8 billion a year.,503,1289
"Increase the supply of small lets by raising the tax-free amount under the Rent a Room Scheme to £7,250 a year.",403,1290
"Abolish the bedroom tax, which has saved less than £400 million a year.",503,1291
"A Department for Work and Pensions report found that more than half of affected tenants have cut back on essentials, and only 1 in 20 has downsized.",503,1292
"Bring Housing Benefit for all age groups back in line with average market rents, so that it provides all citizens with the means to meet their housing costs, costing £2.3 billion a year.",504,1293
Subject the Shared Accommodation Rate to a comprehensive review to ensure it reflects the real cost of renting shared properties.,504,1294
Change the definition of affordable rented housing to depend on local median incomes and not on local market rents.,403,1295
The bedroom tax The under occupancy charge  the bedroom tax  came into effect in April 2013.,503,1296
"It affects nearly 500,000 people  the equivalent of a city the size of Leicester.",503,1297
Two-thirds of those affected are disabled.,503,1298
Cash-strapped housing associations have spent millions helping affected tenants.,503,1299
"By February 2014, two-thirds of residents hit by the bedroom tax were in rent arrears.",503,1300
"The Tories devised it, the Lib Dems backed it and Ed Miliband took a year to decide he didnt like it.",503,1301
Green MP Caroline Lucas has voted against the bedroom tax at every opportunity.,503,1302
"Green councillors and homelessness..In Solihull, Green councillor Chris Williams publicised the plight of a woman who had just had a heart transplant and her 14-yearold daughter who were forced to live in a private hotel for 18 months with rats running through their room as they slept.",503,1303
Since then Solihull has reduced the use of B&Bs to house the homeless.,503,1304
"Imagine a world of sustainable prosperity for all,",701,1306
"one in which secure, satisfying, decently paid jobs are the norm.",701,1307
Where the power to create money is taken out of private hands and democratised for public benefit.,503,1308
"Imagine going to a Peoples Bank, confident that it is working for you rather than for its shareholders.",503,1309
"Imagine that you and everyone else are being taxed with fairness and sustainability in mind,",503,1310
and that tax is actually collected.,305,1311
Imagine working in a more mixed and localised economy.,403,1312
Imagine a revival of workers rights and vibrant trade unions.,701,1313
Imagine knowing that almost half of national income is spent on the common good  on the ties that bind us together  rather than on paying down debts you didnt cause.,606,1314
"This is the common wealth we create by working together, sharing the fruits of our work fairly and building the infrastructure of our common life.",606,1315
"Right now, society is too unequal,",305,1316
"too much valuable work goes unrecognised,",701,1317
and our infrastructure is not fit for a common and sustainable life.,501,1318
The Green Partys proposals will make for a fairer and more sustainable society.,501,1319
People want to work and the Green Party believes in helping make that happen.,701,1321
"We also believe everyone should be properly paid for the work they do, ending working poverty and the job insecurity that has people lining up outside food banks and left at the mercy of payday lenders.",701,1322
"We dont just need jobs, we need more worthwhile secure jobs.",701,1323
"Under the Coalition, 1 million jobs have been lost from the public sector  from the NHS, from schools and colleges, from local government, from the institutions that bind us together, from front-line services.",606,1324
We will put them back.,606,1325
The Coalition claims to have created 2.5 million jobs in the private sector to compensate.,305,1326
"But: Many job-market casualties have turned to self-employment, where life can be precarious and salaries low (there has been a 20% fall in the salaries of the self-employed since 2007, compared with a 6% fall in employee earnings);",701,1327
15% of the workforce is self-employed.,701,1328
"For some this is by choice, for others it is because they cant get better work;",701,1329
"Many new jobs are insecure, poorly paid and with contracts that fail to balance the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees;",701,1330
"The young in particular suffer, with one in three young workers now on low pay;",701,1331
and Theyve redefined some jobs out of the public and into the private sector.,701,1332
"In place of this workplace lottery, the Green Party proposes a package for sustainable prosperity",701,1333
": ending austerity,",503,1334
"expanding and renewing public services such as social care, transport and social housing,",504,1335
"investing in energy conservation and sustainable resource use,",501,1336
and promoting green public works for environmental benefit.,501,1337
This will create 1 million new satisfying jobs and training places within a year.,701,1338
"Green councillors support the living wage... In Lewisham, Norwich, Lancashire, Camden, Worcester, Stroud and Brighton & Hove, minority Green councillors successfully campaigned for a living wage to help tackle poverty.",412,1339
We will: Increase the minimum wage so that it is a living wage.,412,1340
We propose a minimum wage target for everyone who is working in the UK of £10 per hour by 2020.,412,1341
"In 2015 this would mean a minimum wage of £8.10 an hour generally (and £9.40 in London), saving £2.4 billion a year in tax credits and generating an additional £1.5 billion a year in income tax and National Insurance.",412,1342
This would be offset by £0.7 billion a year additional costs in the public sector.,504,1343
"Revive the role of democratic trade unions, including the right to belong to a union and have the employer recognise it,",701,1344
"and the right to take industrial action, including strikes and peaceful picketing.",701,1345
Phase in a 35-hour week.,701,1346
"Apart from improving the quality of our lives, this would combat unemployment by sharing available work out more equitably.",701,1347
"Provide a comprehensive nationwide system of good-quality pre-school early education and childcare, free at the point of delivery.",504,1348
End exploitative zero-hours contracts.,701,1349
"End the exploitation of interns, and ensure no unpaid full-time internship lasts more than four weeks.",701,1350
Make equal pay for men and women a reality.,503,1351
Introduce a maximum pay ratio of 10:1 between the best paid and the worst paid in every organisation.,503,1352
End blacklisting.,503,1353
We will set up a full investigation into blacklisting in the construction industry and consider the creation of a new criminal offence.,503,1354
"Give workers a greater say in the running of their companies, including employee-elected directors in medium and larger companies.",701,1355
Reduce Employment Tribunal fees so that tribunals are accessible to workers.,701,1356
Greens in power carry out our policies,305,1357
"The Green-led administration in Brighton cut the chief executives salary and raised the pay of the lowest grades, bringing the ratio between the highest and lowest paid Council staff to just over 10:1.",503,1358
The UK finance industry is a disaster area.,416,1360
"Far from generating genuine wealth, its recklessness and greed created the greatest recession since the 1930s, which in turn contributed to the present regime of austerity and cuts to public services.",416,1361
"It has presided over other failures, from the mis-selling of endowment mortgages and payment protection insurance, to the appallingly low returns and high charges of the state-subsidised private pensions industry,",416,1362
its failure to mobilise long-term finance for renewable energy,416,1363
and its collusion in and creation of a whole industry of tax avoidance and evasion.,416,1364
"Meanwhile, those who work in the industry at senior level show no signs of remorse and continue to pocket huge salaries and bonuses.",416,1365
Finance needs root and branch reform.,416,1366
"We would: Move towards creating all national currency through a national monetary authority, answerable to Parliament.",416,1367
The power to create money must be taken out of the hands of private banks.,416,1368
Detailed proposals are set out in the Regaining control of our money box.,416,1369
Separate retail and investment banking.,403,1370
Retail banks should be required to limit their role to taking deposits and making loans that facilitate economic activity;,403,1371
investment banks should take the form of partnerships rather than limited companies.,403,1372
Introduce controls on bank lending.,403,1373
Act to control payday lenders and offer alternatives (see the Greens in power credit union box).,403,1374
"We will use the government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland to create a network of local banks for every city and region, ensuring that each bank is a Peoples Bank, obliged to offer cheap basic banking services.",403,1375
"Invest £2 billion in a network of community banks, mutually owned and serving local areas or particular groups.",408,1376
"Expand the role and the funds of the Green Investment Bank by offering green Individual Savings Accounts and pensions, allowing the bank to borrow and boosting the equity in the bank by £9 billion over the Parliament.",501,1377
Introduce a Robin Hood tax (a financial transaction tax) to reduce destabilising speculation (see the Taxes section below for details).,403,1378
Work for the abolition of the City of London Corporation and the special statuses it enjoys.,408,1379
Greens in power carry out our policies,305,1380
"The Green-led administration in Brighton invested £100,000 in a local credit union, partly to help it set up an online system for residents to access loans, making the credit union as accessible as high-interest payday lenders.",403,1381
It also banned such lenders from advertising on Council billboards.,403,1382
"In 2013 Green MP Caroline Lucas worked with East Sussex Credit Union to show ministers how to help credit unions fulfil their potential by, for example, ending the restrictions that put them at a competitive disadvantage when compared with banks.",403,1383
Regaining control of our money One of the most fundamental tasks of government is maintenance of the currency.,412,1384
Without stable money accepted by all we cant buy and sell things or plan for the future.,408,1385
Inflation in particular makes it hard to take the long-term view that the environmental crisis demands.,501,1386
Most people believe that our money is currently created by the nationalised Bank of England.,408,1387
It isnt.,408,1388
A pound in your bank account is no more than a promise by the bank to pay you that pound; you dont actually own any publicly created money.,403,1389
"In fact, commercial banks create new money (in the sense of money in bank accounts) whenever they make loans, and that money disappears when the loan is paid back.",403,1390
The fact that the size of our money supply  the total amount of money in circulation  is dependent upon millions of separate commercial lending decisions by banks makes it hard to maintain economic stability.,403,1391
"During the great recession of the past few years, the unwillingness of banks to make new loans and the desire of people to pay down their debts has meant that the money supply has shrunk, and the government has had to resort to the emergency policy of printing money (called quantitative easing) to prevent an even worse slump.",403,1392
We believe that the time has come to recognise that the creation of currency and the control of the money supply is far too important to be left to profit-seeking private sector banks and should be brought back under the democratic control of the state.,413,1393
Quantitative easing was but a first step.,403,1394
"Commercial banks should be no more than the custodians of publicly created money in current accounts, and the creation of that money should become the function of a new monetary authority, independent of day-today government control.",403,1395
"This policy would protect ordinary bank accounts, and allow banks to fail safely",403,1396
separate ordinary and investment business,403,1397
provide some control on overall lending and debt,403,1398
"This would be a massive and complex change to our banking system, with many ramifications, and its implementation, involving many years of consultation, legislation and the creation of transitional arrangements, would not be appropriate for one Parliament.",403,1399
"But we would take the first steps of preparing detailed proposals and consulting upon them, and Green MPs will press this issue in the next Parliament.",403,1400
"The change to the new system would create a new and substantial cash flow for the government, which could be spent on social and environmental priorities",416,1401
and assist in paying down the national debt.,414,1402
"Most economic activity takes place in limited companies, many of them vast multinational organisations.",403,1404
"The way they are run has a huge effect on our lives, yet their workers, customers and suppliers have no say in them.",403,1405
"Even shareholders are often remote, and their connection with a company, and responsibility for what it has done, can be severed overnight by the simple act of selling their shares.",403,1406
"The economy would be better, more stable and more responsive if there was (a) much greater diversity of economic models and",403,1407
(b) more control by those most directly involved in some of the economic organisations we already have.,403,1408
"We would: Encourage small firms, which are more embedded in their local communities and provide less opportunity for creating huge disparities of income and wealth.",403,1409
Amend company law to ensure that medium and large companies take account of and report on the environmental and social impact of their activities.,416,1410
Amend company law to ensure that medium and large companies have employee and consumer representatives on their boards.,403,1411
Ensure that Companies House actually collects data due from companies and has accurate data on their beneficial ownership.,403,1412
Set local authorities free to run local enterprises for their own communities.,403,1413
Support social enterprise.,403,1414
"Introduce a cooperative development fund managed by community banks to finance new and expanding cooperatives, alongside a much more comprehensive nationwide network of cooperative development bodies providing the necessary education, training and legal support.",403,1415
Grant employees the legal right in certain circumstances to buy out their companies (funded by the Green Investment Bank) and turn them into workers cooperatives;,403,1416
"or, for example, grant the right to turn sporting clubs, in particular football clubs, into community and supporter cooperatives by giving powers for season ticket holders backed by the local community to take over the running of a club.",403,1417
"Expand cooperative education, teaching young people the history of cooperatives as well as how to set them up in practice//.",503,1418
We will ensure business qualifications will give the same emphasis to cooperative and mutual business models as to other private enterprises.,503,1419
The UK economy needs to be more local.,501,1421
Transporting basic foodstuffs all over the planet when they can be grown and sold near to home adds to greenhouse gas emissions and reduces security of supply.,501,1422
"Local businesses are more responsive to local communities and are often better employers than remote, large ones.",403,1423
Income differences are smaller in small firms.,503,1424
"If poorer people are better off, they tend to spend their extra income locally.",403,1425
"So Greens champion small businesses and the local economy, and our Green MP Caroline Lucas was an official Parliamentary champion of the Federation of Small Businesses.",403,1426
We will: Make it easier for small businesses to employ people and contribute towards paying the living wage by using receipts from a wealth tax to reduce employers National Insurance in the longer run to 8%.,403,1427
"Improve the competitive position of small firms, maintaining corporation tax for small firms at 20% while raising that for larger firms to 30%.",403,1428
"Increase access to finance by investing £2 billion in a network of community banks, mutually owned and serving local areas or particular groups.",403,1429
"Reduce the tax on conviviality and help small businesses in the tourism and restaurant businesses by lowering VAT to the reduced rate (5%) for cooked food, entertainment and accommodation, costing £6 billion a year.",403,1430
Keep trade local by allowing local authorities to favour local procurement to help their local economy.,403,1431
Ensure that legislation requiring that small businesses should be paid on time is properly enforced.,403,1432
"In the longer run, simplify PAYE through our Basic Income proposals.",403,1433
"Encourage greater diversity among entrepreneurs, including young people, women, ex-service people, the previously unemployed, people who are disabled and older people.",503,1434
"Ensure that the great majority of honest small businesses can compete fairly with the less scrupulous by cracking down on tax evasion, especially in the informal economy and through non-payment of VAT.",403,1435
Give BT and other public telecommunications operators an obligation to provide affordable high-speed broadband-capable infrastructure to every small business.,403,1436
Green MEP lobbies for VAT exemption for small firms,403,1437
Molly Scott Cato MEP has been lobbying in Europe for VAT exemption for micro-businesses.,403,1439
`This follows new European VAT rules on digital products sold in the EU making VAT chargeable in the place of purchase rather than in the place of supply.,110,1440
Microbusinesses are now therefore obliged to collect VAT from up to 28 different EU states at 75 different rates.,110,1441
"Rules designed to ensure that corporations pay fair taxes have entangled many tiny enterprises, and the complexity of administration involved is putting them at risk.",403,1442
"Molly has called for a VAT exemption for businesses with a turnover of less than 100,000 across the whole of Europe.",403,1443
Many micro-businesses have welcomed her intervention;,403,1444
small businesses are responsible for around 80% of jobs across the EU.,403,1445
Tax is not a punishment and it is not stealing by the state.,503,1447
"It is our money, spent on our behalf by the government we elect.",503,1448
Tax redistributes wealth and pays for services that are important to us all.,503,1449
"There are services we share but dont always use, such as roads, healthcare and schools.",503,1450
"We dont all drive, we dont all go to the doctor and we dont all have children.",503,1451
But we know these things are important for our common life: sharing these things binds us together.,606,1452
Taxation pays for them.,503,1453
"And, to be fair, taxation needs to be progressive, taking proportionately more from those most able to pay.",503,1454
"What should we spend, and on what?",606,1455
"How much should we decide together to spend on the common good, and how much should be left for individuals to spend for themselves?",606,1456
"The pressure in the UK in recent years from the main three parties has been for the state to tax less and spend less, culminating in the dismantling of public services in the name of austerity.",606,1457
"But we need to put this in a wider context, in both space and time.",606,1458
Different countries spend different amounts of their national income on public goods.,606,1459
"The table below compares the Green Party plan, set out in this manifesto, of 45% of GDP spent on public goods with other European countries and the USA, and with the planned decline in investment in the public sphere in the UK.",606,1460
"Every percentage drop represents an assault on the ties that bind us together,",606,1461
on support for those who most need it,503,1462
"and on investment in a democratic, just and sustainable economy.",202,1463
"And the level of spending on the common good has changed over time, responding to changing circumstances.",606,1464
"In 1900, UK government spending was just 14% of GDP.",606,1465
Much of that was defence; there was no welfare state.,105,1466
"Spending climbed to 57% in 1918, the last year of the First World War.",606,1467
"During the inter-war years spending fell back to around 27%, only to climb to a new peak of 70% at the end of the Second World War.",606,1468
"With the creation of the welfare state, spending fell back less after the Second World War, and has moved between 38% and 46% in the past 20 years.",606,1469
What do the cuts mean?,606,1470
Is this a fundamental reimagining of the role of the state?,606,1472
The answer is yes.,606,1473
The Coalition used to say that it was cutting out of necessity.,606,1474
"But this pretence was dropped in 2013 when David Cameron admitted that his commitment to cuts was ideological and permanent: We are sticking to the task... this... means building a leaner, more efficient state.",606,1475
We need to do more with less.,606,1476
"Not just now, but permanently.",606,1477
"Now we know what this means: more for the rich, less for the poor.",606,1478
There are three reasons for a fundamental shift to increased taxation and spending:,606,1479
"To reverse the politically inspired, damaging and unnecessary cuts in public services we have faced in recent years;",606,1480
To improve these services in key areas such as early education and social care for older people;,504,1481
To meet the challenge of building an entirely new sustainable economy in a world where the private incentives of the market are simply not up to the job.,416,1482
Almost half our income for the common good?,606,1483
Thats what sustainability and equity require.,606,1484
"So the first purpose of taxation is to pay for the things we do in common, and to redistribute income and wealth between us.",606,1485
But there is a second purpose.,606,1486
Taxing something discourages us from buying or doing it.,606,1487
Tax on tobacco reduces smoking.,606,1488
Exempting the tax on something encourages us.,606,1489
The exemption of aviation from fuel taxes was instituted long ago in the early days of flying to encourage aviation.,606,1490
We need to use taxation to encourage sustainability and discourage unsustainability.,416,1491
"Finally, for a tax system to be seen to be fair, everyone must pay their tax.",503,1492
"The tax gap  that is, tax that is illegally evaded, legally avoided by exploiting loopholes, or for which collection is abandoned  is estimated to amount to more than £120 billion a year.",503,1493
"Thats more than the deficit, expected to be £75 billion in 2015.",503,1494
"Its more than 30 times the total of benefit fraud, and twice the net cost of a Basic Income scheme.",503,1495
"The Green Party is the only party with the political will to make the system fair,",503,1496
to collect unpaid taxes and to challenge powerful tax dodging both in the grey economy and by huge corporations.,403,1497
"Recent governments cant be serious about collecting tax fairly and efficiently when HMRC staff have been cut from 93,000 in 2004 to just 52,000 in 2015.",305,1498
"Tax dodging Caroline Lucas MP secured a debate with the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke) in order to champion a Fair Tax Mark, much like the Fair Trade Mark, to be awarded to companies that take their tax responsibilities seriously.",403,1499
"Meanwhile, in Europe, Molly Scott Cato MEP worked with other Greens on the European Parliaments Economics Committee to ensure that there will be a full parliamentary inquiry into the scandal of corporate tax avoidance, ensuring that multinational companies will pay the taxes governments need to pay for infrastructure and public services.",403,1500
"Also, as a member of the European Parliaments tax working group, Molly Scott Cato is working to achieve an end to the exemption of aviation fuel from taxation.",501,1501
Green MPs will lead on bringing a Tax Dodging Bill before the next Parliament.,503,1502
"Thats the Green Partys tax policy in a nutshell: tax for fairness and to redistribute income and wealth,",503,1503
and tax for sustainability.,501,1504
To make taxation fairer we would: Introduce a wealth tax of 2% a year on the top 1% (see the Wealth tax box) to raise about £25 billion a year by the end of the Parliament.,503,1505
We accept that such a tax would need to be phased in gradually and that the potential yield is uncertain.,503,1506
"We would tie the yield on the wealth tax to our proposals to lower employers National Insurance (see below); to the extent that revenues from the wealth tax grow, employers National Insurance will be reduced.",503,1507
Get serious about collecting tax.,503,1508
"We would steadily increase staff in HMRC by 15,000 per annum over the Parliament, in particular reopening local offices.",303,1509
"This would cost successively an additional £1 billion each year and is estimated to bring in cumulatively each year an additional £6 billion, still only one-quarter closing the tax gap, and collecting an extra £30 billion a year by the end of the Parliament.",503,1510
"Introduce an urgent programme of legislation, starting with a Tax Dodging Bill designed to reduce the tax gap and establish a general anti-avoidance principle.",503,1511
"Our plans include obliging banks to provide information about companies automatically to HMRC, and abolishing the rule that allows non-domiciled residents not to pay tax on foreign income.",403,1512
"Consider making the £2 billion industry of designing, promoting and selling tax avoidance schemes illegal.",403,1513
"Introduce a Robin Hood tax of 0.1% on transactions in bonds and equities and 0.01% on derivatives, replacing the existing stamp duty on share transactions.",503,1514
This would raise up to £20 billion a year later in the Parliament and would help stabilise financial markets.,403,1515
"Reform Council Tax by asking people in bigger homes to pay more and those in smaller ones less, and adding two additional bands at the top for the biggest homes worth more than around £2 million and £4.5 million.",503,1516
"Under these proposals two-thirds of people would pay less, with the more substantial increases for those in homes worth more than £1 million.",503,1517
Overall this would be revenue neutral.,503,1518
"Make preparations to replace both Council Tax and the Uniform Business Rate by a system of Land Value Tax, where the level of taxation depends on the rental value of the land concerned.",503,1519
"The rates would be decided locally with no caps, and subject to a degree of equalisation between richer and poorer areas, and would be kept and spent locally.",503,1520
"Transition to Land Value Tax could begin by the last year of the Parliament, and then extend over the following 10 years.",503,1521
Further details are in the Land Value Tax box.,503,1522
Abolish the employees National Insurance upper threshold.,503,1523
"This would raise £28 billion a year in a full year from those on higher incomes above £42,380, but we would phase this increase in, with the first half of it in 201617.",503,1524
Raise the additional (top) rate of income tax to 60%.,503,1525
This will help bring down the maximum salary ratio in any workplace from the best paid to the lowest paid to no more than 10:1 and also act as a disincentive to paying excessive salaries.,503,1526
It would raise approximately £2 billion a year.,503,1527
"Not allow corporation tax relief on any part of a salary that exceeds the maximum allowed by the 10:1 ratio in that company, to make it harder for companies to pay excessive salaries.",503,1528
"Increase corporation tax from 20% to 30%, yielding around £12 billion a year in a full year.",503,1529
Small firms would remain on 20%.,403,1530
"Abolish the capital gains tax personal allowance, raising around £3.8 billion a year.",503,1531
Fundamentally reform inheritance tax and turn it into an accessions tax.,503,1532
"At present, inheritance tax is one of the easiest taxes to both avoid and evade, and the very rich usually find ways of paying very little.",503,1533
"We would make the level of the tax depend on the wealth of the recipient, not the donor, so that all bequests to individual recipients who have less than £200,000 would be tax free.",503,1534
This would encourage people to spread their wealth more widely.,503,1535
"Counter avoidance by abolishing the seven-year rule and making all gifts by living donors subject to a similar accessions tax, with exemptions for small annual amounts as at present.",503,1536
In addition we would tighten up the tax treatment of certain trusts widely used for inheritance tax purposes.,503,1537
A wealth tax Most of the emphasis on inequality is about inequality of income.,503,1538
"But there is even more inequality in the ownership of accumulated wealth  property, pension rights, stocks and shares, and other assets.",503,1539
"The top 10% of households hold nearly half the UKs wealth, the top 1% hold at least 12.5%.",503,1540
"Many other countries  France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway for example  levy annual wealth taxes of up to 2%.",503,1541
"The Green Party is part of a movement to build a global wealth tax, the only sure way to counter avoidance and evasion of such taxes",503,1542
The introduction of automatic information exchange for income tax purposes from 2016 from tax havens will make it easier to trace hidden wealth.,503,1543
We would introduce a tax of 2% a year on the 1% of the population whose wealth exceeds £3 million.,503,1544
There will be an exemption for farmers with agricultural land worth less than £10 million.,503,1545
"For those with little income and a rather illiquid asset such as a house, arrangements could be made to defer the tax until the sale of the house.",503,1546
In a full year this tax could raise £25 billion.,503,1547
To tax for sustainability we would commit the UK economy to a long-run plan to reduce the use of natural resources through the introduction of resource and pollution taxation.,501,1548
In particular we would: Begin a major ecological shift in the taxation of companies by removing disincentives to employ people.,501,1549
Specifically we would reduce employers National Insurance contributions by the same amount as the yield from the wealth tax above.,501,1550
"In the long run this will remove £25 billion a year from a tax on jobs, enabling the tax to be reduced from 13.8% of pay to around 8%.",503,1551
"Reintroduce the fuel duty escalator, raising £2.2 billion in 2015 and an additional £2.2 billion in each successive year through the Parliament.",501,1552
"Put aviation on a level playing field with other modes of transport by making it subject to fuel duty and VAT, raising £16 billion in a full year.",501,1553
"If outdated international law makes this impossible, introduce a flight tax dependent on distance and aircraft type that has the same overall economic effect.",501,1554
"Reduce VAT on housing renovation and repair work (including insulation) to 5%, costing £1.6 billion a year.",501,1555
At present there is no VAT on constructing new dwellings but VAT at 20% on converting and renovating old buildings to be used as homes.,501,1556
"Reduce VAT on the tourism industry (meals and drinks out, accommodation and also live performances) to 5%, putting the UK on a level playing field with our international competitors and costing around £6 billion a year.",403,1557
"Tax plastic bags and unnecessary packaging, raising perhaps £1 billion by 2020.",501,1558
"Levy eco-taxes on non-renewables or pollutants, in particular pesticides, organo-chlorines, nitrogen and artificial fertilisers and phosphates, raising £1 billion by 2020.",501,1559
"Introduce new taxes on the use of water by businesses and on waste heat from power stations, raising £3 billion by 2020.",501,1560
Increase alcohol and tobacco duties by a successive £1.4 billion every year in the Parliament.,416,1561
"Land Value Tax Land Value Tax is a system of local taxation where the landowner pays a proportion of the rental value of the land itself, but not of buildings or improvements upon it, in tax each year.",503,1562
"It has many advantages: It taxes the value of land and rents, which derive from nature and the efforts of the wider community and not from any effort by the landowner, rather than taxing wages and profits, which derive from labour and capital;",503,1563
It is hard to avoid because land cannot be hidden or moved;,503,1564
It dampens speculation in land and land hoarding;,503,1565
"It favours tenants in particular, since the tax cannot be passed on from the landowner, and would substitute for Council Tax, which tenants have to pay;",503,1566
and It discourages landowners from not using derelict or vacant land.,503,1567
The land would be valued at the value that could be obtained if sold for the current planning permitted use.,503,1568
"Commons, urban open space, some nature reserves and land used in common such as roads would be exempt.",501,1569
The rate would be set by the local authority.,503,1570
Special arrangements would allow those with land but a low income to pay their Land Value Tax upon the sale of their land or upon their death.,503,1571
A Land Value Tax set at around 2% of total land values would raise about the same amount as Council Tax and Uniform Business Rate combined.,503,1572
"Moreover, 83% of properties would attract lower bills for Land Value Tax than for Council Tax (and many of these would be paid by the freeholder rather than the tenant).",503,1573
Joining up the policies So what does taxation have to do with equality and sustainability?,503,1574
"It can be used to promote both, rather than promote things we dont want.",503,1575
"Its folly to give capital allowances to investment in coal-fired generation,",501,1576
or VAT concessions to new buildings rather than reusing old ones.,501,1577
"Its unjust to spend billions on tax relief on pension contributions used overwhelmingly by the rich,",503,1578
or not to use inheritance tax to encourage people to spread their wealth.,503,1579
Taxation is not just a matter of getting in the money for the common good; we can use it to shape behaviour.,503,1580
"Imagine a tax and benefit system so simple that we could all depend on a small basic income depending on our age, and then, when we did paid work, we simply got taxed at a higher rate the more we earned...",503,1584
"In the world of the current government, social security means exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin.",504,1586
"Living on benefits is to experience constant insecurity, wondering if payments will stretch to cover todays food, next weeks school bus, next months electricity bill.",504,1587
"Its to experience discrimination, as society is divided into strivers and scroungers, the deserving and the undeserving poor, taxpayers and those on benefits",503,1588
"Its to be subject to delayed payments and sanctions, which push you to the food banks.",505,1589
Its to lose up to four weeks payments simply for missing an interview.,504,1590
"Worst of all, the benefits system takes no account of peoples real lives.",504,1591
You can pay more in transport costs to attend compulsory sessions at the Job Centre than you receive in benefits.,504,1592
"All the while, more and more people fall through the cracks in a social security system that, thanks to ideology and incompetence, offers no security.",504,1593
Being on benefits creates a poverty trap that discourages employment or increased hours of work.,504,1594
Yet work in todays UK doesnt pay either.,701,1595
"Its why, for the first time, there are more people living below the poverty line in working families (6.7 million) than in workless and retired families combined (6.3 million).",701,1596
Its why one of modern UKs growth industries is payday loan sharking.,701,1597
And its one of the reasons why nothing short of a Green revolution in how we think about social security will do.,501,1598
"The Coalition government has introduced more work-for-benefits schemes, tougher rules on claiming benefits and more sanctions.",504,1599
Job Centre staff are encouraged to do whatever it takes to get people off the dole and deny them the money to which they are entitled.,504,1600
"Employment and Support Allowance is a disgrace, with harsh, inaccurate fitness-for-work assessments that are frequently overturned on appeal.",504,1601
Claimants suffer because of huge delays in assessment of Personal Independence Payments.,504,1602
"The Coalitions flagship policy, a so-called simplification of the system, Universal Credit, is a disaster waiting to happen.",504,1603
Implementation dates are constantly revised and the computer systems are never quite ready.,504,1604
"Although Universal Credit claims to improve incentives to work, if you earn an extra £100, £65 will be deducted from your benefit.",504,1605
"This is higher than the 45% tax charged on incomes over £150,000, yet we are told that, if we increase that top rate, high earners will lack incentives to work or will leave the country.",503,1606
So should we be surprised if many on benefits decide not to work?,503,1607
"In a sensible world, wed have much lower deductions from earnings for those who earn least.",503,1608
"Instead of entrenching the difference between being in and out of work, which is what mainstream welfare tries to do, the Green Party will work to eliminate it altogether.",503,1609
"Green MP Caroline Lucas and welfare reform In the last Parliament, Green MP Caroline Lucas took a stand against the removal of the link between benefit levels and inflation,",504,1610
"the governments welfare reforms,",504,1611
"the widespread scapegoating of the poor and disabled,",503,1612
and the myth that welfare and other public spending was the cause of the economic recession.,504,1613
"Here are some of her comments: As well as being callous and cruel, the bedroom tax is counter-productive.",503,1614
"If our priority is fairness, we should be seeking savings from those who can afford it, not penalising the poorest and pushing them into ever more precarious misery.",503,1615
The governments misguided austerity programme is leading to social devastation and is economically illiterate.,503,1616
The Green Party thinks the time has come to reconsider the whole tax and benefits system and to rebuild it from the ground up,503,1618
" a system not built on punishing and isolating people, making them jump through hoops to get hand-outs from the state, but one that goes back to the founding principles of the welfare state,",503,1619
"in the belief that, as members of society, we have a shared responsibility for one anothers well-being in times of need",606,1620
and a shared commitment to helping others play the most active role they can in our society.,606,1621
The idea in a nutshell is this.,606,1622
Scrap most of the existing benefits apart from disability benefits and Housing Benefit.,503,1623
Abolish the income tax personal allowance.,503,1624
"Then pay every woman, man and child legally resident in the UK a guaranteed, non-means-tested income, sufficient to cover basic needs  a Basic Income.",504,1625
"For those who earn, the Basic Income compensates for the loss of the personal allowance.",503,1626
"Children will receive a reduced Basic Income, Child Benefit.",504,1627
"Pensioners will receive their Basic Income at a higher level, as a Citizens Pension.",504,1628
The advantages are many and we support the principle of a Universal Basic Income because it has the potential to: Act as a springboard rather than a safety net;,503,1629
people can take jobs without fear of prosecution for working while on benefits;,503,1630
Prevent people falling into absolute poverty rather than trying to help them when they are already there;,503,1631
"Reward people for all the work thats done outside the formal economy, and most of this work is done by women;",503,1632
"Encourage more of this unpaid activity, much of which  such as food growing, fixing things that have gone wrong, converting older buildings, protecting the natural environment  is a vital part of a transition to a more sustainable economy;",501,1633
Avoid the poverty trap in which an increase in wages leads to a massive loss of benefits;,503,1634
"Make everyone who earns, however little, a citizen who contributes to society by paying taxes, giving almost everyone a stake  raising the personal allowance takes us in precisely the wrong direction;",606,1635
Be simple to administer and easy to understand.,303,1636
Basic Income would be a massive change to the entire UK tax and benefits system.,503,1637
We recognise that it would not be practicable or right to carry out that change within a single Parliament.,305,1638
We are publishing alongside but separate from this manifesto a detailed set of proposals for a comprehensive Basic Income scheme.,504,1639
"It contains full details of the scheme itself, costings and proposals on how to pay for it, and an initial analysis of how the scheme would affect the net income of different groups.",503,1640
"We would use the forthcoming Parliament to Consult upon this scheme,",305,1641
"Have government departments carry out and commission research (including research into behavioural changes and how Basic Income would affect those on the lowest incomes and child poverty), and Draft appropriate legislation, with a view to implementing the full scheme in the following Parliament.",503,1642
There are further things we would propose to do in the forthcoming Parliament as steps towards this major reform:,503,1643
Reform the existing working-age benefits regime.,504,1644
Pay an enhanced Child Benefit.,504,1645
Introduce a universal Citizens Pension.,504,1646
A major problem with existing working-age benefits and tax credits is the poverty trap.,504,1648
We would be prepared to invest up to £30billion over the Parliament to reduce the amounts that people lose from their benefits when they move into paid work and to fund the other changes to the benefits regime set out in this section.,504,1649
"In complex ways, eligibility for some benefits (e.g. Jobseekers Allowance) is lost altogether once a person is employed for a certain period, or reduced pound for pound if certain small disregarded amounts are exceeded.",504,1650
"Some other benefits (e.g. Housing Benefit) are reduced in a different way, by withdrawal rates that allow those earning to keep a small part of what they earn and not lose all of it.",504,1651
"We would make small changes in the direction of allowing those who earn some income from paid work to keep more of that income, starting with increasing the disregards for Income Support and Jobseekers Allowance (JSA).",504,1652
"Initially we would increase the income disregarded on JSA for all categories of client to £50 a week,",504,1653
with similar increases for those on Universal Credit.,504,1654
It is not possible to be precise about how much the increased costs of such moves would be offset by more people on benefits taking up employment or working for longer hours.,504,1655
"Depending on results, we are prepared to invest up to £30 billion on such employment-stimulating measures over the Parliament.",504,1656
"We would also explore the introduction of a more generous treatment of earnings within Universal Credit for all claimants, whatever their housing circumstances.",504,1657
"We would also: Halt implementation of the Universal Credit programme and carry out a thorough review of its structure and implementation, including the treatment of earned income, and removing conditionality.",504,1658
"End work-for-benefits programmes, or workfare, and ensure a fair choice of waged work opportunities or voluntary training for jobseekers.",504,1659
Ensure that all those on training or work placements as part of the benefits regime are either in college-based training or at work earning at least the minimum wage.,504,1660
Review the harsh systems of sanctions and benefits caps introduced by the Coalition government and its predecessors.,504,1661
Consider offering more personalised job-seeking support for people with mental health problems.,503,1662
"Restore Council Tax Benefit at the equivalent of 201213 levels for low-income householders, costing around £500 million a year.",503,1663
Cancel the Department for Work and Pensions contracts with the private sector for benefit entitlement assessment.,504,1665
"Restore the link between state benefits and earnings; ensure state benefits rise as fast as prices or wages, whichever of those grows more.",504,1666
Abolish childcare tax credits and tax reliefs in the light of our proposals for free universal early education and childcare.,504,1667
Pay students maintenance grants until Basic Income is introduced.,506,1668
"Raise the minimum wage and outlaw exploitative zero-hours contracts, so that the jobs taken by unemployed people are above a minimum standard.",412,1669
Bringing up a child is expensive.,606,1671
It is also vital work on behalf of society as a whole; those of us without children will depend on the children of others when we grow older.,606,1672
"It is right that society as a whole makes a contribution, as is recognised by our free state education system.",606,1673
"But that system needs two extensions: a free universal early education and childcare service (see Chapter 7 on Education),",504,1674
and a more realistic level of Child Benefit.,504,1675
We will: Raise Child Benefit as from 2016 from £20.70 a week for the oldest or only child and £13.70 a week for additional children in 201516 to £40 a week for each child.,504,1676
Pay for the £15.5 billion net cost of this by using this much of the £28 billion raised from those on higher incomes by abolishing the National Insurance upper threshold.,503,1677
"The bedrock of our pension policy is the Citizens Pension, which, unlike the new flat-rate pension, would be paid to all pensioners regardless of contribution record, and to existing as well as new pensioners, so no pensioner will live in poverty.",504,1679
We would introduce this in 2016.,504,1680
"It will pay £180 a week to a single pensioner or £310 for a couple, taking all pensioners above the poverty line.",504,1681
Increases will be at the higher of the increases in the prices of basic goods and services or in average earnings.,504,1682
"The existing State Pension and Pension Credits cost £90 billion a year, while the new pensions above will cost £116 billion.",504,1683
The net cost is therefore £26 billion.,504,1684
"We will fund this by reducing tax and National Insurance incentives for private pensions by onehalf, raising £20 billion (see the Older people and pensions section in Chapter 5) and using a further £6 billion available from abolishing the National Insurance upper threshold (see the Child Benefit section above).",503,1685
"Joining up the policies So what do housing, pensions and investing in a new sustainable economy have to do with each other?",501,1686
"Pensions need sound, long-run infrastructure to invest in, such as energy generation and social housing.",501,1687
"And, if the pensions system is broken, people will invest in houses instead, pushing up prices and rents.",501,1688
"So, if we create a new pensions system investing in the things we need, and discourage the things such as mortgage interest relief for landlords that encourage investment in housing, 501then we reduce the money chasing existing housing, and prices and rents fall.",501,1689
Its another virtuous circle.,501,1690
Imagine being part of another kind of coalition.,606,1692
"Not the grubby one thats handed democracy over to the private sector, but one made up of elected politicians determined to govern for the common good,",606,1693
"a revitalised local government,",301,1694
"a regulated private sector, the third sector and non-profits",403,1695
 and you and me.,606,1696
Imagine a voting system in which your vote actually counts.,202,1697
Imagine more decisions being taken where they really matter  locally.,202,1698
"Imagine going to your reopened public library, strolling round your well-tended local park, taking your child to a school brought back under local authority control, and visiting an elderly relative in a local authority care home staffed by trained and well-paid carers.",606,1699
"Imagine the end of cronyism, corruption and the Westminster bubble.",304,1700
Imagine Parliament belonging to the people...,202,1701
"We elect politicians to govern in our name, not to hand power over to huge corporations acting in shareholder interest.",202,1703
"Successive governments, and particularly the current one, have outsourced government to the unaccountable private sector.",304,1704
This hollowing out of government is based on dogma  that the private sector does things better than the public sector.,304,1705
Successive scandals and failures of provision have proved this dogma wrong.,304,1706
"But still the contracts get handed out, with the private sector taking all the profit and the taxpayer  you and me  shouldering all the risk.",304,1707
Government has been put out to tender.,304,1708
"Corporate interests, heading a coalition of the rich and powerful, have ruled the roost for too long.",304,1709
This has brought politics and politicians into disrepute.,304,1710
"When things go wrong, the government blames the companies to which it has outsourced its work, and politicians are accused of being on the make.",304,1711
"Some are, as we found out during the expenses scandal.",304,1712
"But many arent, and the Green Party will lead a revolution in standards, putting politics back in the hands of the people and governing for the common good.",202,1713
It is well placed to do this.,305,1714
"The Green Party has made electoral gains at local, national and European level.",202,1715
"Our councillors, our MP and our MEPs work effectively for the people who voted for them.",202,1716
"The biggest lesson of the Scottish referendum was that, when people are given the responsibility for making big decisions, they grab it with both hands.",202,1717
The Green Party will turn the tide on apathy and disillusionment by making these opportunities the rule rather than the exception.,202,1718
"A Green government would: Regulate the private sector in the common interest, including curbing excessive pay for executives and senior managers.",202,1719
Introduce a Public Service Users Bill to bring back into public ownership sectors of the economy on which we all depend.,413,1720
"Recognise that, if government is small, society doesnt automatically become big  the third sector needs strong, enabling government.",202,1721
"Treat citizens as grown-ups, capable of recognising the common good and acting on it.",606,1722
Not accept the dogma that government cannot lead or innovate and has no entrepreneurial drive.,202,1723
We will set creative government free.,202,1724
"Recognise that efficiency in public services does matter, provided it is not at the cost of poor service or exploitation of staff.",303,1725
We would expect to find very modest savings of 0.3% over 50% of the governments operations each successive year.,303,1726
"In contrast, the Coalition has too often described actual cuts in public services as efficiency savings.",305,1727
Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Public Service Users Bill,413,1728
Her Public Service Users Bill would: Make public ownership the default option before any service is sold off.,413,1730
Ensure people are asked  and genuinely listened to  before any service is put out to tender.,202,1731
Give the public a right to recall private companies if theyre running our services poorly.,202,1732
Make private companies running public services more transparent.,202,1733
UK politics is rooted in the past and has lost touch with the present.,204,1735
Our Parliament looks back to feudal times rather than forward to democratic times;,204,1736
we cling to 18 as the age of political maturity despite young peoples growing sophistication and capacity to make decisions for themselves;,204,1737
we legitimise corruption through unfair funding of political parties;,304,1738
our MPs pay more attention to their parties than to the people when it comes to voting  constituents need to be re-empowered.,204,1739
To put this right the Green Party will: Move towards a written constitution with a Bill of Rights.,204,1740
Bring in proportional representation (PR) using the Additional Member System for parliamentary elections,204,1741
and continue fixedterm Parliaments.,203,1742
"Only the 200,000 votes in marginal seats really counted in the last election  thats less than 0.5% of those eligible to vote.",202,1743
We would make everyones vote count.,202,1744
Introduce the right to vote at 16.,204,1745
Reform the House of Lords to become a fully elected body chosen by PR;,204,1746
"but, to promote its independence, members should be elected for only one fixed term of ten years, with half the House being elected every five years.",204,1747
"Bring in a fair system of state funding for political parties so theres no longer a need for reliance on private and trade union donations, which can have a corrupting effect.",304,1748
"Ensure that all lobbying, and in particular corporate lobbying, is registered and fully disclosed, including lobbying of elected politicians and of civil servants.",304,1749
"Immediately repeal the unsatisfactory Lobbying Act, so that civil society organisations can campaign properly.",202,1750
Retain the principle that human rights are the common property of the whole world by keeping the Human Rights Act,201,1751
and retaining the UKs membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe.,201,1752
Aspire to a 50:50 Parliament by 2025 with equal numbers of women and men.,202,1753
Introduce referendums on local government decisions if called for by 20% of the local electorate.,202,1754
Introduce recall referendums on MPs and other representatives if 20% of electors request it.,202,1755
Make equality before the law a fundamental constitutional right.,204,1756
But this is only a reality if all can afford to use the law.,202,1757
"We would restore the cuts to Legal Aid, costing around £700 million a year.",202,1758
The Scotland independence referendum put decentralisation back on the political agenda  a cause that Greens have championed for years.,301,1760
We have long argued that nothing should be decided at a central level that can be decided at a local level.,301,1761
"We need to improve the way the UK is governed, passing power back to the people, back to where they live and work.",301,1762
Local councils have been starved of the funds they need to do their job.,301,1763
"That is why requests for social care go unheeded, libraries are shut and public parks neglected.",301,1764
And it isnt just money.,301,1765
Local democracy is withering and dying because councillors are hemmed about by regulation and their functions have been systematically removed over the past 30 years.,202,1766
Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has virtually abolished onshore wind energy by overriding local planning and halting turbine projects.,301,1767
"We will fund local government properly and extend its functions, reviving local democracy.",202,1768
"We will: Money Provide a £10 billion a year uplift in local authority budgets to allow local authorities to restore essential local services,",301,1769
"creating more than 200,000 local jobs.",701,1770
Add further higher bands to Council Tax to allow authorities to raise more on the largest homes.,503,1771
"Not cap what local authorities are allowed to raise in Council Tax,",301,1772
"allow local councils to conduct revaluations and to set their own multiplier rates, provided they are more progressive,",503,1773
and not require a Council Tax referendum when they do so.,301,1774
Ensure that grant funding is sufficient to pay for all statutory services that councils are required to provide.,301,1775
"To fund discretionary activities, we would allow local authorities to set local business rates, and then distribute the whole of Council Tax receipts and Business Rate receipts between local authorities on a basis decided by a Commission independent of central government set up by local authorities themselves.",301,1776
"Also allow local authorities to levy new local taxes, such as local tourist taxes,",301,1777
"empty homes levies,",301,1778
supermarket taxes,301,1779
"or workplace parking levies,",301,1780
"and to set rates for and keep part or all of some taxes collected locally, such as income tax and VAT, and distribute them as above.",301,1781
"Allow local authorities freedom to set local fines, fees and charges.",301,1782
Put these taxation arrangements beyond future Whitehall revision by giving formal constitutional protection to local democracy and tax-raising powers.,204,1783
Scrap the New Homes Bonus and add the money to the Revenue Support Grant.,503,1784
Not start any new private finance initiative projects,413,1785
"and set local authorities free to borrow to fund local capital investment in social housing, electricity generation and distribution, and local public transport.",301,1786
Set up a fund of up to £5 billion over the Parliament to buy out existing PFI projects where it is a good deal to do so.,413,1787
Democracy,202,1788
"Restore local authority control over education, with full delegation of the appropriate budgets.",301,1789
"Allow local authorities to run local public transport and other local services such as domestic and commercial waste disposal, community energy schemes and local food production entirely as they wish,",301,1790
including using publicly owned and run services and employing social enterprise and voluntary sector organisations.,301,1791
Keep trade local by allowing local authorities to favour local procurement to help their local economy.,301,1792
Give local authorities powers to encourage local live performance in the arts by moving funding from the regional to the local level,301,1793
and modifying regulations so that small-scale live performance in pubs and similar venues is not stifled.,301,1794
"Create an Assembly for Cornwall, with similar powers to the Welsh Assembly.",301,1795
Work for the abolition of the City of London Corporation and the special statuses it enjoys.,202,1796
"Residents will decide on the future governance arrangements for the local functions exercised by the Corporation, with the same division of roles between the local and the strategic as in any other part of London.",202,1797
Planning Require local authorities to set out a local carbon plan showing how their area will meet overall greenhouse gas reduction targets.,501,1798
Put planning back in the hands of local government by: repealing the National Planning Policy Framework,301,1799
and in particular its presumption in favour of economic development;,416,1800
restricting the ability of the Secretary of State to call in planning applications;,301,1801
restricting the right of applicants to appeal only where there has been an error in the planning process;,301,1802
"strengthening local authorities powers to prevent changes of use for important community facilities such as local shops, pubs and meeting halls;",301,1803
"giving local authorities planning powers to support local shops and businesses through planning policies including business conservation areas,",301,1804
"ensuring basic shops are available within walking distance in all urban areas,",501,1805
restricting the number of payday lenders,301,1806
and restricting the power of supermarkets;,301,1807
and introducing a community right of appeal where a development is non-compliant with a neighbourhood plan or local plan.,301,1808
"Support preservation of the historic environment, in part by being flexible about how older buildings reduce their energy use.",501,1809
Constitutional Convention The Green Party supports calls for a Constitutional Convention led by citizens  a Peoples Convention.,202,1810
Wed use that opportunity to make the case for the changes detailed above.,204,1811
"Parts of England, based on groups of local authorities, could come together to exercise greater powers; these might amount to existing regions, or possibly city regions.",204,1812
"The process must be driven by the bottom up decisions of local authorities, not by top down direction.",202,1813
"The Convention would also consider further devolution to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.",204,1814
"As set out above, we favour much greater devolution to and tax-raising powers for local authorities, with this settlement put beyond future Whitehall revision by giving formal constitutional protection to local democracy",204,1815
. Any constitutional changes should be subject to referendums.,202,1816
Greens have long supported the process of devolution in Wales.,301,1818
"We believe that the people of Wales should enjoy the degree of autonomy, perhaps including full self-government or independence, that they wish to have, as expressed in a referendum.",301,1819
"Up until any such referendum, Greens in Wales will focus on improving and maximising the potential of the current devolution settlement.",301,1820
"Reflecting the devolved status of Wales within the UK, the Wales Green Party has an autonomous status within the wider party and publishes independent policy statements and its own manifesto covering all areas of devolved power.",301,1821
"These include matters such as health, education, transport and housing.",301,1822
"Greens in Wales would: Increase real power at all levels, from local councils up to the Welsh Assembly.",301,1823
Increase the number of Assembly members.,301,1824
Push for the National Assembly to become a Parliament with powers equal to those in Scotland.,301,1825
One benefit of these increased powers would be the ability for Wales to fully realise its potential as a producer of clean renewable energy.,501,1826
Greens recognise that cultural diversity is as vital as ecological biodiversity in maintaining and enriching a healthy and fair society.,607,1827
"We would promote and protect this cultural diversity at a grassroots level with the promotion of community radio, television, live arts, etc. in both the Welsh and English languages.",607,1828
Wales Green Party policies would help create the strong local sustainable economies and thriving communities necessary for the future of the Welsh language and the nations rich cultural diversity.,607,1829
We live in the information age and we know that information is power.,201,1831
But how should information be controlled?,201,1832
"What information should be available, and to whom?",201,1833
"The Green Party supports a world of open, freely flowing information.",201,1834
We dont want disproportionate or unaccountable surveillance or censorship.,201,1835
"We want a transparent state, but we want control over the data that our digital lives create.",201,1836
We need copyright laws that reward creators but that are consistent with digital technologies.,201,1837
Above all we want democratic political control of this technology,202,1838
We would consider combining elements of the policies below into a comprehensive Digital Bill of Rights.,201,1839
We would: Oppose any case for secret unaccountable mass surveillance of the type exposed by Edward Snowden.,201,1840
We do accept that government law enforcement agencies may occasionally need to intercept communications in specific circumstances.,201,1841
"Such specific surveillance should be proportionate, necessary, effective and within the rule of law, with independent judicial approval and genuine parliamentary oversight.",202,1842
"Replace the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which has failed to regulate the deployment of undercover police;",201,1843
to support the confidentiality of journalistic sources; // to support legal confidentiality;,201,1844
and to enshrine an open and effective right of redress.,201,1845
Support and protect Internet freedom.,201,1846
Follow human rights judgments limiting surveillance and data retention in full.,201,1847
Support the EUs proposals to strengthen data protection laws against opposition from large US data-driven companies.,108,1848
"Limit the censoring or takedown of content or activity to exceptional circumstances, clearly set out within a comprehensive legal framework.",201,1849
"Make copyright shorter in length, fair and flexible, and prevent patents applying to software.",201,1850
Introduce a more satisfactory law on so-called malicious comments made on social media than the blanket and crude section 127 of the Communications Act 2003.,201,1851
"Oppose the privatisation of data held by the government that should be open to all, such as the Postcode Address File,",201,1852
"or by companies providing public services, such as data on the progress of buses that can be used by Smartphone apps to predict waiting times.",201,1853
"Oppose the sale of personal data, such as health or tax records, for commercial or other ends.",201,1854
Use government purchasing power to support open standards in information technology.,201,1855
How politics is reported is vital for our democracy  active citizenship has to be informed citizenship.,202,1857
Public support for the arts is part of a civilised society.,502,1858
We would: Tighten the rules on cross-media ownership and ensure that no individual or company owns more than 20% of a media market.,403,1859
Support the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics and for the cross-party Royal Charter.,201,1860
But if this is not supported by all the major newspapers we will support legislation to implement the Leveson system of independent press self-regulation.,201,1861
"Maintain the BBC as the primary public service broadcaster, free of government interference, with funding guaranteed in real terms in statute to prevent government interference.",201,1862
Increase government arts funding by £500 million a year to restore the cuts made since 2010,502,1863
"and reinstate proper levels of funding for local authorities, helping to keep local museums, theatres, libraries and art galleries open.",502,1864
Reduce VAT to 5% for live performances.,502,1865
Work to support fair pay productions in the arts.,502,1866
Support initiatives to make the arts and sports accessible to all.,502,1867
"Set targets for participation in sports by women, ethnic minorities and disabled people in particular.",503,1868
Make sure all children get at least a half-day equivalent of sports in school,502,1869
and encourage both the use of schools sports facilities by the community,502,1870
and participation in regional and national sporting events by our young people.,502,1871
Ensure that all have digital access and give BT and other public telecommunications operators an obligation to provide affordable high-speed broadband-capable infrastructure to every household,411,1872
and small business.,403,1873
"This in particular will encourage video-conferencing, helping to reduce both business and family travel.",501,1874
Strengthen controls on advertising directed at children.,403,1875
Value the contribution made by civil society organisations both here and abroad.,606,1876
"In particular, we would repeal the Lobbying Act 2014 (see the Green MP opposes the Lobbying Bill box below).",201,1877
Support state funding of political parties.,202,1878
Give fair representation to political parties in televised debates.,202,1879
"Caroline Lucas opposes the Lobbying Bill At every stage of the Lobbying Bills progress through Parliament, Green MP Caroline Lucas was at the forefront of attempts to stop the Bill becoming law.",201,1880
She was one of a group of MPs who tabled an amendment to reject the Bill outright and was a vocal critic of moves to drastically curtail the debate we need for a healthy democracy.,202,1881
"Caroline campaigned for legislation that would shine a real light on lobbying activity and criticised the Coalitions proposals for letting most corporate lobbyists off the hook, at the same time as effectively gagging the activities of civil society groups speaking out on anything from housing policy to wildlife conservation.",201,1882
She tabled an amendment to the Bill that would have opened up to proper scrutiny how much is spent on lobbying,202,1883
 as well as who is doing it.,202,1884
She called for details to be made public about when staff transfer between the civil service and the private sector.,304,1885
And she has stood up in Parliament time and again to reiterate the Green Partys commitment to repealing whats dubbed the Gagging Bill.,201,1886
"Imagine being able to leave your car in the garage  or not needing one at all... because reliable, affordable public transport, coupled with safe, clean, welcoming streets for walking and cycling, meets your transport needs.",501,1887
Could that not be the real world?,501,1888
"Like so much else, the UK has got transport upside down.",501,1889
"The big picture is a world of finite resources, especially the type that runs much of our transport  petroleum.",501,1890
"This is running out, and we know we need to leave much of what is left in the ground.",501,1891
We have to create a transport system based on sustainable alternatives.,501,1892
"We also have an increasingly car-dependent population because the cost of public transport has risen faster than wages and faster than the total cost of driving,",501,1893
and in many areas public transport is so scarce that people have little alternative but to get around by car.,501,1894
This has led to a public health crisis caused by rising levels of physical inactivity and health-damaging air pollution.,501,1895
"We also face an increasing toll of death and injury on the roads, particularly among pedestrians and cyclists who face unacceptable danger in our vehicle-dominated and congested towns, cities and villages.",501,1896
"Our privatised railways are fragmented and uncoordinated, ticket prices are high and unpredictable, and timetables do not connect seamlessly with buses at stations.",413,1897
This means rail fails to play its full part in delivering an effective alternative to the private car.,501,1898
Long-distance travel by air is one of the most energy-intensive and polluting forms of transport and causes health-damaging local pollution near airports.,416,1899
"Aviation fuel goes untaxed and there is no VAT on tickets, amounting to a £16 billion a year subsidy in the UK.",416,1900
"We need a shift in priority, removing subsidies from air travel to invest in public transport that supports the common good.",416,1901
"In the long run we have to create a transport system that is socially just and addresses health inequality by prioritising affordable access to services by walking, cycling and public transport,",416,1902
"by reducing road danger,",501,1903
by cleaning up our air,501,1904
and by minimising congestion.,501,1905
"This transport system should use electricity, not oil,",501,1906
"and make our towns, cities and villages into more liveable, socially inclusive places.",501,1907
"Against this backdrop, mainstream transport policy, which urges us to travel further and faster than ever before, is senseless, yet this is what all parties except the Green Party offer you.",416,1908
"The key to getting this right is to manage demand rather than increase it; that is, to reduce the need to travel in the first place.",416,1909
"We need to: Reduce the distances travelled,",501,1910
reduce the number of journeys made by car,501,1911
"and switch as many journeys as possible to walking, cycling and public transport;",501,1912
"Encourage alternatives to travel, such as video-conferencing;",501,1913
Integrate different transport options and provide seamless doorto-door journeys;,501,1914
"Prioritise everyday access for everybody wherever they live to local facilities such as the shops, the doctors surgery, schools and workplaces;",501,1915
and Enable more people to get to where they need to go while using a car less.,501,1916
"Green Party transport policy prioritises in this order, building from the bottom up:",501,1917
walking and disabled access to all other forms of transport;,501,1918
cycling;,501,1919
"public transport (trains, light rail/trams, buses and ferries)",501,1920
and rail- and water-borne freight;,501,1921
"light goods vehicles, taxis and low-powered motor cycles;",501,1922
private motorised transport (cars and high-powered motor cycles);,501,1923
heavy goods vehicles;,501,1924
and aircraft.,501,1925
Green councillors mean safer streets...,501,1926
"Green councillors were instrumental in bringing in 20 mph limits on many residential roads in Norwich, Islington and Leicester, as well as a default 20 mph limit on all residential roads in Lancashire and in Brighton & Hove.",501,1927
"For trains to play their part in the total journey experience, they need to connect seamlessly with buses and convenient walking and cycling routes to local centres of habitation.",413,1929
The Green Party is committed to bringing rail services into public ownership and control.,413,1930
"The current fragmented structure does not put the passenger and the total journey experience at the centre of planning and has created a costly, wasteful, uncoordinated outcome.",413,1931
"Recent experience in running the East Coast Main Line within the public sector has shown that both quality and receipts to the Treasury go up when a rail service is run in this way,",413,1932
"whereas experience on the West Coast Main Line in the private sector shows that the franchise system is costly, wasteful and not fit for purpose.",413,1933
The Green Party will consult widely on the organisational details of a rail operation in public ownership and how it will link to democratic accountability at the regional and city-region geographical scales.,413,1934
Diesel exhaust emissions are a known human carcinogen,501,1935
"and diesel trains do not perform as well as electrified rail operations in terms of passenger comfort, acceleration and deceleration, and the ability to make more stops at intermediate stations with minimal impact on overall journey time.",501,1936
The Green Party wants to see electrification of the railway system to achieve levels to be found in Germany (59% of track electrified) or Sweden (73% electrified).,501,1937
The UK has 34% of its track electrified.,501,1938
"High levels of electrification reduce health-damaging air pollution,",501,1939
reduce greenhouse gases,501,1940
and deliver a much-improved passenger experience.,501,1941
"Electrification will also require new rolling stock and the Green Party will promote the design and manufacturing of this new stock in the UK,",501,1942
contributing to job creation in those regions with higher than average unemployment.,701,1943
"Putting this plan into action for the common good means bringing the railways back into public ownership  making them belong to you and me, run by rail workers for passengers.",413,1944
"On 26 June 2013, Green MP Caroline Lucas published a Private Members Bill to do just this, a policy supported by 66% of the British public.",413,1945
The privatised railways cost over £1 billion a year in: Interest payments; Debt write-offs; The costs of railway fragmentation; The profit margins of tiers of contractors and sub-contractors;  Payments to shareholders; and Bonuses paid to railway bosses (up to 166% of annual salaries).,413,1946
"Between 1997 and 2013, rail fares leapt by 22%, while road users have experienced a 9% drop  exactly the wrong priority.",413,1947
Rail isnt really private anyway  60% of the network is owned by state-backed foreign companies.,413,1948
And this private system takes £4 billion in public subsidies every year.,413,1949
Labours response is to require the state to bid for franchises it already owns  at millions of pounds a time.,305,1950
"As Caroline says, a privatised railway is a blatant transfer of public money to private interests at the expense of the taxpayer and rail passengers.",413,1951
Bringing the railways back into public ownership would cost very little if it was done as existing franchises fell due for renewal.,413,1952
This will: Save money;,413,1953
Mean a better deal for passengers;,413,1954
Allow local authorities to plan and run local services;,301,1955
Increase the scope for the democratic involvement of local communities in planning and running railways;,202,1956
and Reduce congestion and improve safety.,501,1957
"In addition on the railways, we would not support HS2 (the proposed high-speed network).",416,1958
"The money to be spent on this hugely expensive project, which at best will reduce journey times for a few passengers, would be much better spent on improving the conventional rail connections between various major cities,",416,1959
improving the resilience of the existing network to climate change,416,1960
and reopening lines and stations that have been closed.,416,1961
The major challenge for our transport system is to decarbonise it and end its reliance on fossil fuels.,501,1963
"We would: End the wasteful and destructive national major roads programme, saving £15 billion over the Parliament.",416,1964
"Spend part of this £15 billion on improving and subsidising public transport, with an average fare reduction of 10% costing £8 billion over the Parliament,",413,1965
fixing potholes in existing roads,411,1966
and investing in walking and cycling.,501,1967
Support walking and cycling.,501,1968
"In particular, we would ensure that pedestrians and cyclists get their fare share of road space and would spend at least £30 per head on them over every year of the Parliament.",501,1969
"Funding should be allocated flexibly to make safe, convenient routes that address the needs of pedestrians and cyclists while reducing any risk of conflict between them.",501,1970
"Support the re-regulation of bus services to provide a better, more reliable service.",413,1971
End the favourable tax treatment of aviation,416,1972
and have a separate target for aviation emissions of below 37.5 million tonnes CO2 equivalent a year.,501,1973
"Stop airport expansion, in particular no new runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick,",416,1974
and ban night flying.,501,1975

Reduce the alcohol limit for drivers to as close to zero as is practicable.,411,1996
Require newly manufactured lorries to be equipped with best practice technology to make sure that drivers are fully aware of the presence of all pedestrians and cyclists.,411,1997
"Pedestrian and cyclist fatalities and serious injuries when involved in collisions with lorries are predictable, preventable and unacceptable.",411,1998
"The technology already exists and is in use in several countries and consists of a mixture of in-cab screens linked to cameras, multiple wing mirrors and physical modification to prevent people being dragged under the vehicle.",411,1999
Lorries already in use must be retro-fitted with the same equipment and lorries not so equipped will not be allowed into our towns and cities.,411,2000

Approximately 20% of the UK population live in rural areas and many of these are retired and may have to adjust to a lifestyle without a car for health and income reasons.,503,2025
It is essential that rural areas get the best possible deal for widening transport choices.,503,2026
The Green Party does not accept that there is a fundamental and intractable rural transport problem.,501,2027
"Rural transport in many parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland is of a very high quality and the quality is based on careful planning, coordination and investment and recognition that, although a car will be needed for a proportion of journeys, it is not the default option.",501,2028
"The small village of Gempen in Switzerland, with a population of about 800, has ten buses each day that connect with tram and train services at the next-larger settlement (Dornach).",501,2029

Some of this wealth will need to be shared with poorer countries that have left their fossil fuels in the ground and their forests still standing.,107,2115
"In these ways, by an agreed date, every citizen of the world will have a fair and equal share of global emissions potential.",107,2116
Being rich will no longer permit people to unfairly affect the whole worlds atmosphere and climate.,107,2117
The UKs recent history has been scarred by involvement in ill-advised military interventions that have undermined our national and international security.,105,2119
"The Green Party opposed these interventions, which have brought havoc to Iraq and Libya and only fragile gains in Afghanistan,",105,2120
as well as driving an increased terrorist threat closer to home  all at the cost of many precious lives and vast amounts of money and other resources that could have been better used for other needs.,105,2121
Green MP Caroline Lucas challenged the PM in the debate on 26 September 2014 on military action in Iraq Will the Prime Minister recognise that killing extremists does not kill their ideas?,105,2122
"On the contrary  it can often feed their ideas, and for that reason the former MI6 head of counter-terrorism has said that getting Saudi Arabia and Iran around a negotiating table would be far more effective than bombing.",106,2123
"Why are we not hearing far more from this Prime Minister about the political and diplomatic solutions to this situation, rather than reaching for the military solution, which could undermine them?",105,2124
We will restructure and update the UKs security and defence establishments and services so that they contribute to the international good.,107,2125
"We will: Pursue a policy of defensive defence, which threatens no one yet makes it clear that threats and attacks will be resisted.",104,2126

"If we werent involved in wars in the Middle East, terrorism here would lose its raison dêtre.",106,2151
"With less fossil fuel we would have to expand renewables and grow more of our own food, making us far less vulnerable to blockade in any future war.",501,2152
"Security policy is not just about tanks, its also about acting responsibly and building resilience at home.",501,2153
Its another virtuous circle..,501,2154

"environmental protection,",108,2161
"the spread of culture and ideas,",108,2162
and regulation of the financial system.,108,2163
"And in other areas, such as welfare policy, open discussion and coordination are useful.",108,2164
"However, we prioritise local self-reliance rather than the EUs unsustainable economics of free trade and growth.",110,2165
"We would not adopt the Euro, which cannot work properly without much deeper political integration, and this would be contrary to our policy of subsidiarity.",110,2166
We support the proposal to have an inout referendum so that the British people can have their say.,202,2167
This is because much has changed since the UK joined the Common Market in 1974.,110,2168
"Endless debate on membership is a diversion from more important matters, such as ending inequality and adapting our economy to One-Planet Living.",110,2169
"So its yes to Europe,",108,2170
yes to reform of the EU,108,2171
but also yes to a referendum.,202,2172
Migration is a fact of life.,607,2175
People have always moved within countries and between countries.,607,2176
"Much of the UKs language, culture and way of life has been enriched by successive new arrivals over thousands of years.",607,2177
"Most families living here will have members of their extended family who live abroad or include members who were born abroad  5 million British citizens live abroad, around 2 million of them in the EU.",607,2178
"We take it for granted that we can move to live where we like within our country, and increasingly within Europe and further afield, as others do.",607,2179
"Much of the time, migration is voluntary, is on a relatively small scale and is a positive benefit for all concerned.",607,2180
"But, increasingly, people are being forced to move because Climate change affects their environment so that it can no longer support them;",107,2181
The economic opportunities in their home country are so limited that they leave home to work abroad;,107,2182
"or War, natural disasters or political repression lead them to become refugees.",107,2183
These pressures lead to growing numbers of people seeking to come to the UK from the EU and elsewhere.,107,2184
"But it is wrong to scapegoat immigrants for problems with housing, education, health or local authority services.",503,2185
"These problems are the result of successive governments policy failure, which the rest of this manifesto is designed to put right.",107,2186
"The Green Party believes that, in the medium to long term, we must reduce the pressures that lead to involuntary migration.",107,2187

We accept that these policies will take time to work and that we must address immigration as it is here and now.,416,2195
"Some controls on immigration will be needed for the foreseeable future; for now, we reject an open borders approach.",403,2196
We also reject the imposition of an arbitrary numerical cap on net migration.,403,2197
The latter in particular is impossible to achieve (especially given that there is no control on the numbers emigrating) and leads to many individual injustices.,503,2198
Any controls must respect the following principles: Mutual legal obligations within the EU on freedom of movement.,108,2199
"International obligations to accept refugees, whether seeking sanctuary from wars, political repression or climate change.",107,2200
Respect for the integrity of families.,603,2201

No restrictions on foreign students.,503,2205
"Foreign students contribute hugely to our education system, both financially and in terms of the wider perspectives they bring.",607,2206

In particular we would allow students to work in the UK for two years after graduation;,607,2208
widen the Youth Mobility Scheme to allow those from poorer countries to participate.,107,2209
No priority simply for economic reasons.,503,2210
We would in particular aim to retain more of those trained in the UK in the health service so that we have less need to take health service workers from countries that can ill afford to lose them.,107,2211
We would also: Review the rules for those wishing to set up or do business here to ensure they are not discriminatory against smaller businesses.,403,2212
Not simply accept people just because they are rich.,503,2213

They should receive a temporary right to stay and have the same right to apply to remain as others seeking to migrate.,503,2226
People around the world have their own strategies and priorities for improving their lives and communities.,107,2228
"Development should not be directed by rich countries, which too often have their own business interests in mind.",107,2229
"Instead we need to provide the political space, democratic voice and appropriate resources to enable people in all countries to pursue their own chosen directions in ways that work for them.",107,2230
"International trade can benefit or harm the worlds people, depending on its nature.",107,2231
"Genuinely fair trade, alongside sustainable haulage practices, can bring benefits for all of us.",107,2232
"But ever-growing trade, over ever-growing distances and with the sole aim of making a profit can make life difficult for workers and is a sure-fire way of exceeding the limits of our finite planet.",107,2233
"Similarly, the worlds current structure of international institutions and trade rules can put less developed economies at a disadvantage, while making it easy for global corporations to buy up their land and resources.",107,2234
We need to work with others around the world to reform and reinvent these institutions so that they facilitate greater global equality and justice.,107,2235

"Ensure that every country has the political space to make its own democratic choices,",202,2246
without pressure to prise open its economy for free trade.,202,2247

The question of Irish Unity is a fundamental democratic choice for all the people of Ireland.,602,71
It is about the power to choose who we should be governed by and the power to build a country that reflects our priorities as a nation.,602,72
The real democratic value of Irish Unity will be that the people of Ireland north and south are in charge.,202,73
It will no longer be possible for governments to be elected and pursue policies against the wishes of all the Irish people.,602,74
"The republican vision of a united Ireland is based on the principles of equality, inclusion and sovereignty.",602,75
"There can be no place for sectarianism, exclusion or discrimination.",503,76
The identities of all citizens must be respected and supported.,606,77
This includes those who cherish their British identity.,606,78

Sinn Féin has called for a referendum on Irish Unity to be conducted in the next political term.,602,80
"We are seeking an informed, reasoned and respectful dialogue on the issue of Irish reunification.",204,81
The right to a referendum on Irish Unity is one of several outstanding issues within the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements which the British Government needs to act upon.,602,82

Since coming to power the Tory-led British Government has removed £1.5 billion from the budget in the north.,602,91
Parties that received no popular mandate from the people have cut the public service budget allocated to the north in the form of the Departmental Expenditure Limit in 2014 by 14 per cent.,602,92
This cut has a huge impact on our budget.,602,93
In addition to this they have sought to impose harsh welfare cuts on vulnerable citizens.,602,94
They are threatening further cuts after this election.,602,95
This is not acceptable or sustainable.,602,96
"The British government attack on the north has led to greater inequality, reduced health and education services and lower living standards.",602,97

"Ensuring that the economy in the north is just, equal and sustainable is a key objective towards securing and maximising the return and stability of the island economy for all citizens north and south.",416,147
The current relationship between the Stormont and London means that Westminsters economic and political needs will always supercede the needs of our people and our economy.,602,148
"The debate on EU membership, the British HGV levy, agriculture and fisheries,  and the Tory welfare cuts agenda represent but a few examples of British policy development that has undermined the needs of the people and economy of the north.",602,149
They ignored the reality that the economies north and south are interlinked and interdependent and put British needs first.,602,150
The Tory party is advocating a vote on future membership of Europe.,108,151
There is no consideration of the needs of the people of the Six Counties and the consequences of leaving the EU on this part of Ireland.,108,152
If there is a referendum on European membership then there must be a separate and binding referendum here so our people can be masters of our own destiny.,108,153
"Economic growth, investment and jobs will not be driven by Westminster but from the Assembly.",301,154
"The current economic arrangements for the north, where only some powers are allocated to the north have created a fundamentally unstable economy.",301,155
We need the powers to manage and grow the economy,301,156
and we need our public services to benefit from growth.,301,157
"In order to build a strong progressive tax base, to increase jobs and growth and to work towards eradicating in-work poverty, policy responsibility for taxation must be vested in the Assembly and Executive.",301,158

and the setting of a minimum wage must be returned.,301,166
Sinn Féin welcomes the transfer of powers on corporation tax to the Executive.,301,167
We are working to ensure that we receive the full benefit of any decision to reduce the Corporation Tax rate.,301,168
That means that any financial benefits flowing from a reduction must be retained and reinvested here to provide for better public services,301,169
and economic growth.,410,170
Sinn Féin continues to negotiate on that basis.,301,171
"The price of maintaining the union is further austerity, economic stagnation, poverty and inequality.",602,172
That is a price we cannot and will not pay.,602,173
Immediately seek the transfer of all economic and fiscal responsibility to the Executive and Assembly ensuring all tax revenues are retained in the north rather than returned to Westminster.,301,175
This means control of and access to all  receipts including those which are currently collected by Westminster.,301,176

Integrated island-wide co-operation within public services makes economic sense.,602,216
"With vision, commitment and determination we could deliver better services to all the people of Ireland.",602,217
Sinn Féin are proposing the following workable solutions:,305,218
Full and detailed examination of delivery models of integrated public services across the island.,602,219
Identification of all-island shared projects from planning stage to completion.,602,220

Review the regulatory barriers to doing business on the border.,402,225
Examine and present solutions to address the impediments for businesses transferring staff north and south.,402,226
The Tory party has focused on cutting welfare protections to those most in need.,504,228
"While other parties supported these cuts Sinn Féin held out and achieved protections at Stormont House for families with children with disabilities,",504,229
"adults with severe disabilities,",504,230
the long-term sick,504,231
and larger families.,503,232
This agreement must now be honoured.,504,233
There can be no further attacks on those most vulnerable in our society.,503,234
However the British Government have not just stopped at welfare they have has also undermined the rights of workers.,701,235
Being in work is no longer an escape route out of poverty as employers are not required to pay a Living Wage.,701,236
Zero-hour contracts dont guarantee a weekly income.,701,237
"Flexible working can indeed be a benefit to employees as well as employers, but only if it is based on a guaranteed income",701,238
and guaranteed hours.,701,239
Lack of adequate housing is a major cause of poverty.,503,240
"The shortage of adequate social housing is forcing many people into the private rented sector, where the quality of housing is not guaranteed and where landlords can charge exorbitant rents.",504,241
We recognise the need to increase the stock of social housing and have set out a plan to do that.,504,242
Ensure the full implementation of the welfare protections agreed in the Stormont House Agreement.,504,244

During the negotiations which led to the Stormont House Agreement Sinn Féin resisted attempts by the British Government and other parties to have current and future inquests removed from Coroners Courts and placed within the remit of the Historical Investigations Unit.,602,288
Once again the British government and its allies within unionism sought to thwart the efforts of embattled families seeking the truth about the circumstances of their loved ones deaths.,602,289
For Sinn Féin this was a red-line issue we would not cross.,602,290
That resistance has ensured that families will have Article 2 compliant inquests and we will continue to give full support to them as they seek to achieve maximum disclosure from a reluctant British government.,602,291
The creation of the Historical Investigation Unit (HIU) provides families with the opportunity to learn more about the truth surrounding the death of their loved ones.,602,292
The Stormont House Agreement commits the British government to making full disclosure to the HIU and we will be seeking to ensure that they do not resile from their commitment to supply all of the relevant information to the families.,602,293
We continue to press the British government to hold a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane.,602,294
"During the negotiations in December the Irish government, despite its alleged support for such an inquiry, failed miserably to address this issue and hold the British government to account.",602,296
The families of the Dublin/Monaghan bombings and the Ballymurphy massacre are still waiting on information in files held by the British government so as they can learn the full truth regarding the death of their loved ones.,602,297
"In the Stormont House Agreement both governments recognised that there were outstanding investigations and allegations into conflict-related incidents, including a number of cross-border incidents and committed to cooperation with all bodies involved to enable their effective operation.",602,298
We will be working to ensure that the British government provides all information to the Barron Inquiry.,602,299
"We will be working to ensure that the British government provides all information to the families of Pat Finucane,",602,300
of the victims of the Dublin/Monaghan bombings,602,301
and of the Ballymurphy massacre.,602,302
Sinn Féin have honoured all agreements that we have entered into.,305,305
Making and implementing agreements is the foundation stone of the political process.,202,306
"There are key elements of the Good Friday Agreement that have still not been implemented, including a Bill of Rights",201,307
and the establishment of a Civic Forum.,202,308
In addition at Weston Park the British government agreed to establish a full inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.,602,309
At St Andrews in 2006 there was a commitment made by the British government to legislate for the Irish language through an Acht Gaeilge.,602,310
They reneged on those commitments too.,602,311
Since the Stormont House Agreement was reached on the cusp of Christmas Eve Sinn Féin has engaged positively with the Party Leaders group to ensure its full implementation.,301,312
This includes the provision agreed to protect welfare benefits,504,313
Sinn Féin continues to demand the implementation of all outstanding agreements,504,314

"and the rights of citizens,",201.2,10
including the rights of workers.,701,11
"This has assisted the growth of far-right parties, which exploit peoples fears.",602.1,12
Brexit is a consequence of that.,108,13
Brexit is not the answer.,108,14
Brexit will have a detrimental impact on the Good Friday Agreement and the principles of the peace process,106,15
as well as devastating consequences for the economy across Ireland.,410,16
The alternative to Brexit is designated special status for the North within the European Union.,108,17
This can be done within the current constitutional arrangement.,108,18
The only other way to prevent Brexit is through a United Ireland,301,19
The EU has shown itself to be flexible in dealing with different forms of integration and different forms of relationships for member states and non-member states.,108,20
Designated Special Status would preserve access to the Single Market and Customs Union;,108,21
ensure that we retain the Common Travel Area,108,22
and maintain access to all EU funding streams.,108,23
Delivering designated special status for the North within the EU.,108,25
"Continued political representation for the north of Ireland within the EU Parliament and ministers from the Six County Executive should continue to attend EU Council of Ministers meetings, when necessary.",108,26

Special provisions to allow the North to seamlessly resume full status within the EU in the aftermath of a successful Irish Unity referendum.,108,28
Sinn Féin believes there should be a referendum vote on Irish unity within the next five years.,202.4,30
A strong vote for Sinn Féin in this election will strengthen that demand and advance the imperative of ending partition and for reunification.,301,31
The imposition of Brexit and cuts from the Tories demonstrates the unjust and undemocratic nature of partition and the union.,202.1,32
"Partition divided our people,",606.1,33
"our economy,",408,34
"our public services,",504,35
and the democratic system.,202.1,36
It was wrong and it has failed.,301,37
Ending partition has now taken on a new dynamic following the Brexit referendum.,301,38
Brexit and the imposition of an EU frontier across Ireland has the potential to further entrench partition.,301,39
"For all of Ireland to prosper, partition needs to be eradicated, not reinforced.",301,40
The Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements provided for greater all-Ireland cooperation and a peaceful democratic pathway to Irish Unity.,106,41
The European Council has acknowledged that in the event of a vote in support of Irish Unity all of Ireland would be part of the European Union.,108,42

"Over recent years, Tory governments at Westminster have cut hundreds of millions from public services in the North and sought to impose swingeing cuts on those most in need in society.",504,54
Sinn Féin believes public services should be properly financed and that financial supports are given to ensure people can have a decent standard of living.,504,55
Tory austerity has not impacted on everyone in the same way.,503,56
They have pursued a policy of tax cuts for the rich while the poorest have had their benefits cut.,503,57
"Despite the Tory cuts, Sinn Féin has sought to protect front-line services and to defend the most vulnerable in our society.",504,58
"However, the Torys tax and cuts agenda continues to increase poverty",504,59
and inequality.,503,60

The Executive could be re-established tomorrow if the Tory party and the DUP lived up to their responsibilities.,305.1,76
Instead the talks have been suspended by the Tory party for a self-serving election.,305.1,77
We have again heard repeated refusals from the DUP to support an Irish Language Act and opposing funding to promote the Irish Language by Belfast City Council.,607.1,78

"Michelle ONeill as health minister received the Bengoa Report, a plan to transform the health service in the north.",504,97
We want to see it resourced and implemented.,504,98
The biggest threat to this plan and to your health services is Tory party cuts and the DUP Brexit.,504,99
"In the north, 8.8% of registered doctors come from other EU countries and many others received their medical training in the south.",504,101
There are no arrangements in place to ensure that these crucial staff can remain or have their qualifications recognised.,504,102
"Services such as paediatric cardiology in Dublin, the new Radiotherapy Unit in Derry, out-of-hour GP services in Castleblaney, and Inishowen, and ENT services at Monaghan, Daisy Hill and Craigavon hospitals have all reduced patient travelling times and waiting lists.",504,104
These services and agreements are now at risk due to Brexit.,504,105
EU membership provides access to healthcare in other European countries.,108,107
"Post-Brexit, your European Health Insurance Card will no longer guarantee you free treatment if you fall sick while travelling or working in the South or in an EU country.",108,108
You will face additional health insurance costs.,108,109
Brexit threatens not just the free movement of health workers but also induces a chill factor where people may no longer come here to deliver the services we need.,504,110

The Tory party at Westminster have proposed cutting the education budget.,506,120
Sinn Féin is for investing in education and offering opportunities to our young people to study and travel abroad.,506,121
Tory cuts and the DUP Brexit will end access to EU funds and supports to research and students.,506,122
Brexit will cut 30 million PEACE IV funding from 350 schools,506,124
"as well as funding for 7,000 marginalised young people who are not in education, employment or training.",504,125
Higher Education Institutions and other researchers here have accessed 15.5 million funding from the Horizon 2020 programme.,411,127
This funding stream for new projects will end with Brexit.,411,128
The EUs Erasmus+ programme supports inter-European opportunities for students to travel and study aboard.,706,130
This is under threat by Brexit.,706,131
There is also no guarantee that qualifications will be recognised in any European country.,706,132
"Students from the North who wish to study in the South face the prospect of tuition fees levied at the International Student rate which is between 6,750 and 49,000, more expensive than the current 3,000 charge.",706,134

"Sinn Féin believes in a rights-based society,",201.2,150
with equality and mutual respect at its core.,503,151
Under Brexit your rights and agreements will be further eroded.,201.2,152
The Tory party plan to scrap the 1998 Human Rights Act (HRA) and to remove the British Government from any international human rights accountability.,201.2,154
The HRA gives effect to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and grants access to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).,201.2,155
Access to the convention and court are fundamental commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.,201.2,156
"The ECHR affords protections for fundamental rights including; freedom from torture, the right to a private life, the right of cultural identity, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom from discrimination and the right to life.",201.2,157
The scrapping of the HRA would restrict access to this essential Human Rights court.,201.2,158
"Brexit will mean the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights would not apply, and the EU Court of Justice (ECJ) would not be the final arbiter in providing rights protections.",201.2,160
Access to the ECJ has been vital to ensuring that women are entitled to equal pay for equal work despite British courts having denied them this for seven years.,503,161
It took a decision of the European Commission to ensure that women not only received equal pay for being in the same job as a man but also that they received equal pay for doing work of equal value.,503,162
"EU law ensured that women could not be dismissed because they were pregnant, overturning a ruling in a British Court that such a dismissal did not constitute sex discrimination.",503,163

"In the pursuit of Brexit, the DUP and Tory party are prepared to lay waste to our rural communities and farming economy.",703.1,173
The farming sector is both a major food provider and a major employer.,703.1,174
The north is a net beneficiary of EU funds.,108,176
Our agriculture sector is heavily dependent on EU funding via direct payments/single farm payments from the Common Agriculture Policy.,703.1,177
It is estimated that 87% of farm incomes come from these payments.,703.1,178
"Brexit would represent a loss of £236 million per annum to farmers, an average of £10,184 per farm,",703.1,179
as well as also removing £186 million from our Rural Development Programme.,703.1,180
The DUP has supported a Tory Party that refuses to commit to replacing funds lost by Brexit.,703.1,181
"Brexit will impose costly barriers including tariffs, origin checks, more paperwork, physical border checks and two different regulatory regimes.",108,182
"A large number of animals and products travel north and south for processing, slaughter and breeding every day.",703.1,183
"Brexit will have massive implications on the sale, marketing and price of these products should no solution for country-oforigin labelling be found.",108,184
"EU Regulations ensure a high standard of produce, Brexit exposes us to the vulnerability of cheap imports as the Tories pursue trade deals which reflect their needs and not those of producers in the north.",108,185

and barriers to trade.,407,196
What is required is a pro-active detailed strategy to deal with the special and unique circumstances faced by the island of Ireland including protecting all-Ireland trade and dealing with the huge challenges in relation to future trading arrangements between the EU and Britain.,407,197
"Sinn Féin wants to realise the potential of our economy free, from a border.",407,198

we must retain membership of the EU.,108,205
"Put simply, Brexit is bad for business",410,206
and bad for workers.,701,207
"The EU is an important market, buying over £5bn of our goods and services last year, the majority of which was all-Ireland trade.",407,209
Brexit will place additional costs and restrictions to this trade.,407,210
"Despite the rhetoric of frictionless and seamless borders, the reality is the Irish government is already preparing the customs sites that will be required to enforce the new control and regulatory regimes that Brexit will entail.",407,211
"Offering access to the single market is key to our attraction as a location for inward investment, particularly in higher-skilled and higher-paid sectors.",408,213
The loss of access to the EU market will undermine our attractiveness to FDI,408,214
and cost thousands of jobs.,701,215
"The EU is an important source of Structural Funds, designed to reduce regional disparities in wealth, income, and opportunity.",503,217
Brexit will lock the North out of these funds with a knock-on impact across Ireland with a potential loss of 982 million.,503,218

Public services: investment and reform Renewal of our public services is at the centre of new Labours manifesto.,301,149
"A single aim drives our policy programme: to liberate peoples potential, by spreading power, wealth and opportunity more widely, breaking down the barriers that hold people back.",301,150
"But this is only possible on the continued foundation of economic stability: mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances.",408,151
"Here we set out some of the key measures for investment and reform that we believe give us a historic opportunity to modernise our schools, NHS, criminal justice system and welfare state.",504,153
"New Labour believes that Britain needs investment in schools and hospitals, not reckless tax cuts.",504,155
Before 1997 we promised and kept to two tough years on spending to get the public finances in shape.,504,156
"Now, consistent with meeting our fiscal rules, we promise substantial rises for key public services.",504,157
"To help deliver our plans, our ten-year goal is the renewal of local government.",504,158

- use a £400 million reward fund for local government in return for signing up to clear targets to improve local services.,301,164
New Labour believes in renewing a public service ethic by giving frontline staff new freedoms to respond to public needs.,704,166
"For public services to be renewed, we will need more staff, properly rewarded.",704,167
"It is these frontline staff, operating in new ways, who will drive up standards in our key public services.",704,168
We will decentralise power to make that possible.,301,169

- provide a good-quality nursery place for every three-year-old.,506,201
"New Labour believes that the NHS needs radical reform to fulfil its founding principle of quality treatment based on need, not ability to pay.",504,203
The NHS needs radical reform if it is to be designed around the needs of patients.,504,204
Investment is vital but not enough.,504,205

"We have a ten-year vision: higher living standards, affordable mortgages and fairer taxes combined with much greater investment in vital public services.",408,247
Economic stability is the foundation.,408,248
We know the price of boom and bust  it was paid in the 1980s and 1990s by millions of hard-working families.,408,249
"Our reforms since 1997 have helped cut interest rates to nearly half the average under the Conservatives, saving mortgage payers on average £1,200 a year.",408,250
"By 2010, we want Britain to break away from the decades of boom and bust, as we stick to clear rules for spending and borrowing.",414,251
"We will take no risks with economic policy, make no compromise on fiscal responsibility.",414,252
Stability comes first.,414,253
But stability is not enough.,414,254
"We need to produce more, better and to a higher value to raise our earning power and to meet our ten-year goal of faster productivity growth than our main competitors.",410,255
"We must make Britain the best place to do business in Europe  a dynamic economy, founded on skills and knowledge, developing the talent of all our people, and contributing to sustainable development.",410,256
"That means investment by private and public sectors in infrastructure and skills, and the right competitive framework to support enterprise, small and large, manufacturing and services.",403,257
"Every extra trained, employed worker contributes to a fairer society, as well as a more prosperous one.",411,258
"With social failure, from school drop-outs to crime, comes economic failure.",606,259
Fairness and enterprise go together.,606,260
It is up to government to do everything it can to help ensure that no individual and no community is left behind.,503,261
"We know the risks of promises that cannot be paid for: the Conservatives led Britain into two deep recessions, double-digit inflation, record unemployment, 15 per cent interest rates and a doubling of the national debt.",305,264
Independence for the Bank of England and longterm fiscal rules have given the UK the most stable and transparent economic framework in Europe.,414,266
"Britain now has the best combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since the 1960s.",408,267
"We are saving nearly £9 billion this year from debt and unemployment, so 84p of every extra pound of public spending goes on national priorities, compared to 58p under the Conservatives.",305,268
"So we will pursue a balanced approach on the economy with stability the foundation, more investment not less and, as affordable, targeted tax cuts on our priorities.",414,269
Our aim is to put more wealth in the hands of more people.,408,270
"That is why we will keep mortgage rates as low as possible, ensure competition keeps down household bills, support savings and share ownership, and create a new Child Trust Fund for every child at birth to invest for when they reach adulthood.",408,271
But we showed during the Asian economic crisis how to steer a course of stability in turbulent times.,305,273
"We will continue to work at international level to minimise global economic turbulence, and to protect Britain if it occurs.",406,274
Fiscal responsibility and monetary stability are the foundation of our future plans.,408,276

We will guarantee a minimum family income of £225 for a 35-hour week;,408,294

"The first-ever National Minimum Wage for Britain, bitterly opposed at every stage by the Conservatives, has been a success in our first term.",305,296
"It fulfils, after 100 years, a founding ambition of the Labour Party.",305,297

"To encourage more saving, we will maintain the £7,000 contribution limit for the next Parliament.",414,303

"To boost the savings habit, we will create a new Savings Gateway for people on lower incomes where their savings will be matched by the government.",414,305
"To raise living standards, our ambition is to raise our productivity faster than our competitors and to ensure our goods and services are competitive in world markets.",410,307
We are passionate about giving every child the chance of a decent education.,506,311
But we are equally determined to offer learning opportunities to adults.,411,312
"Our ambition is for everyone to have the opportunity to train, in a partnership of employers, employees and government, each giving time and/or money to raise standards of skills in the UK.",411,313
"Our first priority is to help the estimated seven million adults who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, with 750,000 people achieving basic skill levels by 2004.",411,314
" ensure that job seekers get the benefit of a basic skills test, as well as incentives and obligations to take courses to tackle literacy and/or numeracy problems",411,316
" set up a network of 6,000 IT learning centres around the country.",411,317
" extend Individual Learning Accounts, which have already been opened by over a million people.",408,318
 dramatically improve the quality and quantity of prison education.,506,319
 tackle the financial barriers that prevent adults studying in further education.,506,320
Basic skills are the start; updating skills is relevant for all of us.,411,321
We have created the Learning and Skills Council for all post-school learning outside higher education.,506,322
Further education colleges have a critical role to play in the future.,506,323
"We will encourage dedicated colleges for under-19s and specialist adult provision to meet local skills needs, with half of all colleges to be recognised as centres of vocational excellence by 2003- 04.",506,324

"We need a step-change in workplace learning, particularly in small and medium-sized firms.",403,327
We are determined to develop a three-way partnership to bring this about.,405,328
"Current arrangements have secured increased participation, but not enough.",405,329
Unions and employers have a key role  but we also need to motivate individual employees.,405,330
"Where both sides of industry in a sector agree, we will help set up a statutory framework for training.",411,331
We will boost the efforts of trade unions to raise skill levels by giving statutory backing to union learning representatives and supporting the Union Learning Fund.,405,332
Government has a wide-ranging role to play and is seeking to develop a training tax credit.,402,333
We will look to business and unions to come forward with proposals on how they can contribute to meeting the nations training goals.,405,334
"Everyone has a responsibility to help deliver a high-skill, high-productivity economy.",405,335
"Since 1997 extra investment of £1.5 billion over three years has given science a fresh start, and a new stream of university funding has helped create new links between scientific breakthroughs and new products.",411,338
But we need to invest more to be at the cutting edge of science  in biotechnology and genome research.,411,339

"We will argue for the extension of food labelling, to give consumers more choice.",703,551
Genetically modified (GM) foods and crops have caused concern despite stringent safety checks.,501,552

It is also important to reform the Common Fisheries Policy to preserve fish stocks for the future.,703,554

"Excellence for the many, not just the few is our driving passion.",506,642
Our goal is to develop education to harness the individual talents of every pupil.,506,643
"Since 1997 rising standards have been achieved through major new investment and significant reforms: 17,000 schools have had vital repairs or refurbishment; 20,000 schools are now connected to the internet; there are nearly half a million fewer primary pupils in classes of more than 30; over 150,000 teachers are set to receive a £2,000 pay rise above the usual annual increase; every school is getting additional grants of up to £110,000 paid direct; and there are 11,000 more teachers and over 44,000 more support staff and classroom assistants.",506,644
"Our partnership with teachers has achieved what OfSTED calls a transformation in primary school standards, thanks to smaller infant class sizes and major reform in the teaching of literacy and numeracy skills.",506,645
"Our task now is to achieve a similar transformation in secondary education, liberating the particular talent of every child.",506,646
"Our pledge to parents is clear: children should be on track to achieve their best, or receiving extra expert help to catch up.",506,647
"Money alone cannot guarantee a good education, but extra investment is indispensable to achieving our ambitions.",506,649
We pledge a further step-change in investment in return for a further step-change in standards.,506,650
In 1997 Labour promised to increase the share of national income devoted to education.,506,651
"Over this Parliament, we have increased it from 4.7 per cent to 5 per cent  £540 extra per pupil in real terms  and we are pledged to raise it to 5.3 per cent by 2003-04.",506,652
Investment in buildings and equipment has trebled.,506,653
"During the next Parliament, we will again increase the share of national income for education.",506,654
That is why we are doubling investment in early years education.,506,657
There is now a free nursery place available for every four-year-old.,706,658
Our new Foundation Stage provides a distinct phase of learning appropriate for the early years.,506,659
"By 2004 every three-year-old will be entitled to a free nursery place in the private, voluntary or statutory sector.",706,660
OfSTED will help drive up standards.,506,661
Children with special educational needs will have those needs identified earlier.,705,662
We will continue to provide services which integrate early years education with childcare.,506,663
"By 2004 we will have 100 Early Excellence Centres as beacons of good practice providing care and education for children from 0-5; we will set up 500 Sure Start Centres in disadvantaged areas to support childrens early development; and we will provide an extra 100,000 places offering wraparound care linked to early education.",504,664
But Labour will not be satisfied until every child leaves primary school with the basic skills they need.,305,670
"We are setting targets for an 85 per cent success rate for 11-year-olds in English and maths, and will provide further intensive support for teachers to meet them.",506,671
Primary education without the basics is a betrayal; but every parent rightly wants far more.,506,672
"We will provide primary pupils with wider opportunities to learn sports, musical instruments and a foreign language.",506,673
Transforming secondary education is the critical challenge of the next decade.,506,675
We reject a return to the 11-plus.,506,676
The principles of inclusion and equality of opportunity remain central to our commitment to liberate the potential of every child.,506,677
"But, on their own, they are not enough to guarantee high standards.",506,678
"Standards have risen in the past four years, particularly among pupils in less advantaged areas.",506,679
Strong school leadership and better teaching have turned around 700 failing schools.,506,680
But the challenge ahead is immense.,506,681
Too many pupils fall back and become disillusioned in the first two years of secondary school.,506,682
"Just half of 16-year-olds currently gain good school-leaving qualifications, and levels of drop-out remain too high.",506,683
The dramatic advances at primary level mean pupils will increasingly arrive at secondary school demanding the best.,506,684
We will radically modernise comprehensive schools.,506,685
Headteachers must have the freedom and resources necessary to run their schools effectively.,704,688
We have improved pay and training for headteachers and delegated more funding to schools.,704,689
"Where they demonstrate success, we will further extend their freedom to manage their schools effectively.",704,690
We will reduce the regulatory burden on all schools.,506,691
We will modernise the secondary curriculum to promote higher standards and better progression from school and college to university or work-based training.,506,693
All pupils should reach the age of 14 fully competent in a broad range of subjects.,506,694
Effective teaching is the key.,506,695
"We will develop the literacy and numeracy strategies in secondary schools with the right balance of targets and flexibility, particularly for pupils not up to standard in the basics.",506,696
"We will set demanding targets for high achievement by the large majority of 14-year-old pupils in English, maths, science and IT tests  the passport to future success.",506,697
"We will promote more effective pathways beyond 14, including high-quality vocational routes that build on the new vocational GCSEs and A-levels.",506,698
We will ensure there is an apprenticeship place for every young person who reaches the required standard.,411,699
"We want every secondary school to develop a distinct ethos, mission and centre of excellence.",506,701
Specialist schools offer the full national curriculum to the whole ability range while developing a centre of excellence  and their rates of improvement outstrip the national average.,506,702
"Having trebled their number since 1997, we have pledged to expand their numbers to at least 1,500 by 2006, on the way to making specialist status available to all schools ready for it.",506,703
"We will encourage more church and other faith-sponsored schools, where parents wish it.",603,704
"We will establish more City Academies, and promote greater innovation in the supply of new schools with local consultation.",506,705
We will allow greater involvement in schools by outside organisations with a serious contribution to make to raising standards.,506,706
We will extend provision for gifted children as we nurture childrens special talents.,506,707
"As part of our reform of the vital further education sector, we will encourage the development of free-standing sixth-form colleges.",506,708
"Schools with sixth forms will be guaranteed their funding for pupils in real terms, provided numbers are maintained.",506,709
"We are committed to expand Educational Maintenance Allowances so they cover 30 per cent of the country, and build upon them on the basis of the experience.",506,710
Pupils will be given greater opportunities through the promotion of partnerships between schools.,506,711
We will build on the partnerships established between the state and private sectors.,506,712
"We will invest nearly £8 billion in school buildings and equipment over the next three years, including the construction of 650 new or completely refurbished schools.",506,714
"IT has enormous potential to raise standards, and it is vital that every child leaves school able to make use of the new technologies.",506,715
"Today, nearly all schools are connected to the internet.",506,716
Labour is committed to spend £1.8 billion over six years on equipping our schools for the information age.,506,717
We will pioneer Curriculum Online to ensure materials are available to pupils in school and at home.,506,718
"We are committed to continue to extend access to IT for pupils and teachers, including the possibility of a national leasing scheme to make top-quality hardware available at very low prices.",506,719
Good schools also depend on parents and the local community.,506,721
We will continue to ensure that headteachers have the powers they need to tackle disruption and unacceptable behaviour in schools.,506,722
"Local education authorities will focus on supporting school improvement, especially weak and failing schools, and delivering services that cannot be provided by individual schools.",506,723
We will ensure better training and support for school governors.,506,724
"Schools should be used more effectively as assets for the whole community, including for childcare and community learning.",506,725
We will pilot extended hours schools to develop this resource.,506,726
We will build on the success of more than 40 study centres based in leading football clubs by extending community involvement to other sports.,502,727
Over time we want to develop safe places for children to play outside school hours and every pupil to have access to a summer school programme.,502,728
An Academy for Talented Youth will be established in partnership with a leading university to pioneer summer and other dedicated provision for those with special talents.,706,729
We have significantly improved support and provision for children with special needs or disabilities.,705,730
"They should have access to the best possible education, with appropriate support, whether mainstream or special schooling most suits their needs.",705,731
"Schools in the toughest areas, and the teachers who work in them, need special support.",506,732
"We will expand the Excellence in Cities programme for urban secondary schools, with extra help for the weakest schools, learning mentors and in-school units to help manage pupil behaviour.",506,733
"Where LEAs cannot effectively support school improvement, alternative provision will be made.",506,734
"For schools facing exceptional pressures, for example very high pupil turnover, we will provide additional support, including significant reductions in the size of teaching groups where appropriate.",506,735
Nothing in education is more important than having good teachers.,704,737
"We have made teaching a far more attractive career, through better pay, better incentives to train including training salaries and loan write-offs, more recognition and improved support.",704,738
The General Teaching Council and National College for School Leadership are both now up and running.,506,739
We want teaching to be a career of choice for the best graduates and attractive to people making career changes.,704,740
We will continue to invest more in the profession and improve conditions for teachers.,704,741
"High status, better salaries and proper professional support are all essential.",704,742
"We are conducting a strategic review of teacher workload and the right balance between teaching and administration, central direction and local discretion.",704,743
"We will build on its findings significantly to improve support for teachers in the classroom and in administrative tasks, so they can concentrate on their job.",704,744
" recruit 10,000 extra teachers and improve the adult:pupil ratio",704,746
 support teachers in the classroom by employing more adults to help them,704,747
 invest in rapid promotion and rewards for classroom excellence,704,748
" boost recruitment and retention packages for teachers, particularly in high-cost areas and schools facing exceptional challenges",704,749
" create new routes into teaching, including train-to-teach courses accredited as part of undergraduate degrees and a stronger training mission for outstanding schools",506,750
 further improve in-service training opportunities for teachers,704,751
" develop school achievement awards that reward staff in 7,000 fast-improving schools a year",704,752
 subsidise new PCs for teachers so that they have direct access to the latest technology.,704,753
"It is time for an historic commitment to open higher education to half of all young people before they are 30, combined with increased investment to maintain academic standards.",506,756
In 1997 we inherited a system where the number of qualified people able to go to university was capped.,305,757
"Today, the numbers are rising and universities have the funds to expand, with new two-year foundation degrees to offer students the option of a vocationally relevant, high-quality qualification as a way into skilled work or further study.",305,758
"Over the next three years, we will continue to expand student numbers, taking us towards our 50 per cent target.",506,759
We will maintain university entry standards while intensifying efforts to extend the huge advantages that a university education confers to able young people from all backgrounds.,506,760
"University summer schools, master classes and mentoring support will be offered to potential students from disadvantaged areas through a new Excellence Challenge programme, backed up by £190 million of funding.",506,761
We will not introduce top-up fees and have legislated to prevent them.,506,762
Since 1997 we have increased university funding by more than a billion pounds a year over the Parliament  and invested considerably more in research.,305,763
"Our new system of university finance ensures that 50 per cent of students pay no tuition fees at all, that no parents pay more than under the old system, and that students pay back loans progressively when they are earning.",506,764
We will ensure that the funding system continues to promote access and excellence.,506,765
We will strengthen research and teaching excellence.,411,766
It is vital that our world-leading universities are able to compete with the best internationally.,411,767
We will also support world-class research and the development of public-private partnerships.,411,768
We are determined to ensure that our universities have the freedom and incentives to meet our ambitions for them.,411,769
Reforms to the inspection system for teaching will slash red tape for higher performing departments.,506,770
"Labours ten-year NHS Plan is our strategy for ensuring fast, convenient, high-quality care in all parts of the country.",504,777
"We will implement it through the next Parliament and, if elected, beyond.",504,778
Reform will be driven through primary care trusts (PCTs) as power and resources are decentralised to frontline staff.,301,779
"Today, waiting lists are down by over 100,000 and waiting times are falling.",305,781
"There are 17,000 more nurses, over 6,500 more doctors, and over 9,000 more therapists, scientists and technicians working for patients.",305,782
The biggest-ever hospital building programme is under way.,305,783
"NHS Direct, the 24-hour nurse helpline, is available across the country.",305,784
Eye tests for people who are 60 and over are now free.,305,785
But there is a lot more to do.,504,786
We are committed to investment and reform.,504,787
"With Labour, in just four years the NHS will have grown by a third.",305,788
Spending on the health service is now rising by an average of over six per cent a year in real terms  the biggest sustained increase in its history and double that under the Conservatives.,305,789
"Provided that as a country we maintain economic stability, we will, if elected, be able to sustain significant funding increases throughout the next Parliament.",504,790
So over time we will bring UK health spending up to the EU average.,504,791
That money will help us get the basics right.,504,793
"By 2005 there will be 10,000 more doctors and 20,000 more nurses, with ward sisters in charge of ward budgets.",504,794
"Matrons will make sure that hospital food is good and wards are clean, with power to stop payments to contractors who fail to keep hospitals up to scratch.",704,795
"Nightingale wards for older people and mixed sex wards will be abolished, and mental health wards will be modernised.",504,796
"There will be 7,000 extra beds in hospitals and in intermediate care.",504,797
"And we will build 100 new hospital developments by 2010 and 500 one-stop primary care centres, with over 3,000 GP premises modernised by 2004.",504,798
We are investing an extra £7 billion of capital investment into the health service.,504,799
We have said that Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should not be delivered at the expense of the pay and conditions of the staff employed in these schemes.,504,800
"We will seek ways in which, within the framework of PFI management, support staff could remain part of the NHS team.",504,801
Our job is not just to improve the nations health service.,504,803
It is to improve the nations health.,504,804
Deaths from cancer and heart disease are too high.,504,805
There has been a growing health gap between rich and poor.,504,806
" making the fight against cancer, heart disease and stroke the top priority for investment and reform, with earmarked extra funding of £1 billion by 2004.",504,808
The number of cardiologists will increase by around half and cancer specialists by nearly a third by 2005 compared to 1999- 2000.,504,809
Waiting times for cancer treatment will be cut.,504,810
"Our ambition is to prevent 300,000 avoidable deaths over the next decade",504,811
" tough targets to close the health gap to cut deaths in poorer communities and among poorer children improving mental health services, and a new emphasis on prevention, with more screening services including for conditions like sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and newborn hearing problems",504,812
 offering the worlds best smoking cessation services to help the seven in ten smokers who say they want to give up,504,813
 giving children aged four to six in nursery and primary schools a free piece of fruit every school day  the biggest boost to child nutrition since free school milk was introduced in 1946.,504,814
We remain committed to our bill  blocked by the Tories  to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship.,504,815
"With Labour, by 2004 Patients will be able to see a GP within 48 hours.",504,819
"By the end of 2005 we will cut maximum waiting times for outpatient appointments from six months to three months, and for inpatients from 18 months to six months by expanding staff numbers and reforming how care is delivered.",504,820
"Major conditions like cancer and heart disease will have priority, with all patients treated according to clinical urgency.",504,821
We will give patients more choice.,705,822
We have restored the right of family doctors to refer patients to the hospital that is right for them.,504,823
Now we will redesign the system around the needs of patients.,705,824
Same day tests and diagnosis will become the norm.,504,825
"By extending the use of NHS Direct and increasing the numbers of dentists, patients will get easier access to NHS dentistry wherever they live.",504,826
Specially built surgical units  managed by the NHS or the private sector  will guarantee shorter waiting times.,504,827
"We will use spare capacity in private-sector hospitals, treating NHS patients free of charge, where high standards and value for money are guaranteed.",504,828
It would be wrong to push people into paying for their operations.,504,829
"That is why we reject the approach of the Conservatives, which would lead to this outcome.",305,830
"By the end of 2005 every hospital appointment will be booked for the convenience of the patient, making it easier for patients and their GP to choose the hospital and consultant that best suits their needs.",705,831
"From next year, if an operation is cancelled on the day of surgery for non-clinical reasons, the hospital will have to offer another binding date within 28 days, or fund the patients treatment at the time and hospital of the patients choice.",504,832
"By modernising all maternity units, increasing the number of midwives and giving women greater choice over childbirth, we will ensure that women receive the highest quality maternity care.",504,833
"There will be tough new standards for care of children, the elderly and people with conditions like diabetes, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease and epilepsy.",504,834
We will further tackle the lottery of care as we direct local health authorities and trusts to fund drugs and treatments recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).,504,835
"Genetic services will be extended in the NHS so that more patients enjoy the benefit of the latest advances in testing and treatment; but we will ban by law human cloning, and implement a moratorium on the use of genetic tests for insurance, following a recommendation of the Human Genetics Commission.",504,836
We will continue to examine demographic and technological challenges as they affect the NHS.,504,837
"Patients will have more say, as in the NHS Plan.",705,838
We will give every citizen a personal smartcard containing key medical data giving access to their medical records.,504,839
"Older people, people with disabilities and their carers will be able to decide which services they want, with the choice of having cash given to them directly by local councils.",705,840
Patients will be represented on trust boards and have more information on local services quality.,705,841
To achieve this vision there will be clear national standards but greater decentralisation to frontline services and to the staff who run them.,301,843
Locally agreed personal medical services schemes will be extended.,504,844
By 2004 all local healthcare will be organised by primary care trusts (PCTs) run by frontline doctors and nurses.,504,845
"Together with the new care trusts, combining health and social services, PCTs will control 75 per cent of NHS funding.",504,846
With more power for PCTs we will cut the number of health authorities by two-thirds and devolve to the remainder the functions of NHS Regional Offices.,301,847
We will use the savings of £100 million a year for investment in frontline services.,504,848
"Hospitals and other local services will have greater control over their own affairs and access to a £500 million performance fund, while consistently failing NHS hospitals will be taken over by successful NHS hospitals.",301,849
Appointments to trust boards will no longer be made by ministers but by an independent panel.,301,850
"None of these ambitions will be possible without major investment in the skill, working conditions and working practices of all NHS staff.",704,852
"There will be extra pay too in high-cost areas, with pressure relieved through expanded staff numbers, reformed working practices and investment in training.",704,853
Every NHS employer will offer more flexible working hours for staff and especially nurses.,704,854
Childcare provision will be improved and we will offer targeted subsidies for childcare for NHS staff.,704,855
The pay system will be reformed to make it fairer.,704,856
"As set out in the NHS Plan, there will be new contracts for GPs and hospital consultants, coupled to extra money.",704,857
We will examine the case for a public-private partnership with a commercial mortgage lender to make home ownership more affordable for nurses and other staff.,704,858
We will set up a University of the NHS to guarantee to staff at all levels opportunities for training and career development.,411,859
"Healthcare assistants, porters, cooks and cleaners will be offered an individual learning account worth £300 a year to develop their careers.",411,860
"We will examine the potential for sabbaticals to help GPs, consultant nurses and consultants keep their skills up to date.",704,861
"There will be new systems to learn from when things go wrong, a core education curriculum for all health professionals and reforms to modernise the way health professions are regulated.",411,862
"We will take action to protect NHS staff from violence and abuse, and reform the clinical negligence system.",704,863
This is a vision worth fighting for.,504,864
"It will take time to achieve, but this is the most comprehensive plan ever put before the British people to improve the state of the nations health and our health service.",504,865
It will deliver an NHS to be proud of.,504,866
Government can and must make sure the opportunities are there.,502,871
"But, for the last 20 years, under-investment, misplaced priorities, and lack of organisation held back access and excellence.",305,872
Since 1997 this has begun to change.,305,873
We have started to invest and to reform the system.,305,874
Investment in theatre develops the film and television stars of tomorrow; investment in sport will produce the Olympic and Paralympic medal winners of 2012.,502,875
Culture and sport should not be seen as peripheral issues  they are vital to our identity and enjoyment as a country.,502,876
"We are pledged to the investment necessary to expand access and excellence together in culture and sport, building on excellence in film and broadcasting.",502,877
Labour is committed to a radical extension of sporting opportunities and facilities.,502,880
"Sport is a good health policy, a good crime reduction policy, a good way of building communities.",502,881
"We pledge a sports entitlement for all children, giving them access to at least two hours a week of sport in or after school.",502,882
"Thanks to our ban on the enforced sale of playing fields and a commitment of nearly £1 billion to new sports facilities and 1,000 school sports co-ordinators, all children will be offered coaching and competitive games.",506,883
Children with talent need more investment: we have pledged to fund 200 specialist sports colleges.,506,884
"We will maintain the elite funding we put in place for individual athletics, with a first-class athletics stadium for the World Athletics Championships in 2005 and a new stadium in Manchester for next years Commonwealth Games.",502,885
"We are committed to sell the Tote to a racing trust to allow it to compete commercially, with all long-term profits invested in the sport.",502,886
We are committed to finding ways to support the amateur sports clubs to which 5.6 million people now belong.,502,887
The House of Commons elected in 1997 made clear its wish to ban fox-hunting.,502,888
The House of Lords took a different view (and reform has been blocked).,502,889
Such issues are rightly a matter for a free vote and we will give the new House of Commons an early opportunity to express its view.,502,890
We will then enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on this issue.,502,891
If the issue continues to be blocked we will look at how the disagreement can be resolved.,502,892
We have no intention whatsoever of placing restrictions on the sports of angling and shooting.,502,893
"Yet the Conservatives introduced charges for our national museums and galleries, cut the arts budget, and reduced support for arts education.",305,897
Since 1997 that has changed.,305,898
National museums are already free for children and pensioners.,502,899
Labour is committed to reform the VAT system to ensure they will be made free for everyone from December.,502,900
"By 2004, arts funding will be 60 per cent above its 1997 level in real terms.",502,901
"An extra £25 million a year will go to regional theatre, increasing the number and quality of productions for audiences in England.",502,902
"We have invested in our orchestras, and put an extra £10 million a year into developing our regional museums and galleries.",502,903
"We have maintained our commitment to the nations heritage and to its historic buildings, and we will continue our drive to put architectural quality at the heart of the design of new public buildings.",502,904
Education is the bedrock of an artistic society.,506,905
"We are once again giving children the opportunity to learn music, and we will ensure the opportunity is available to all.",506,906
New creative partnerships  linking schools with artists and arts organisations particularly in disadvantaged areas  will offer children the chance to develop artistic and creative talents.,506,907
We will build on the pilot projects.,506,908
"We have made the largest-ever investment in computerising libraries; all will be on-line by 2002, with guaranteed standards to meet users needs.",502,909
"From 2002, Culture On-line will offer children and adults alike tailored access to our national collections and cultural activity over the internet.",502,910
We will create new specialist arts schools and city academies to offer specialist education to the most talented young people.,506,911
"Public money devoted to the arts should be spent on excellent art, not bureaucracy.",502,912
"The Arts Council is undergoing substantial reform  creating a simpler structure which gives more power to the regions, cuts bureaucratic costs further, and which can deliver a better service to individual artists and arts organisations.",502,913
"We will ensure that our arts funding system backs excellence, giving artists and arts organisations the long-term stability they need to become world leaders.",502,914
"Creative entrepreneurs need seed funding, cheap accommodation near other similar companies, and advice on how to develop their talent into a business.",411,918
"To meet those needs, we now plan to provide start-up advice, services and funding for new businesses.",411,919
"Venture capital will be available through RDAs, and a creative industries champion will be appointed in every Business Link.",411,920
"Under the Conservatives, many communities missed out on their fair share of lottery money.",305,922
The number of grants to community groups has trebled with Labour.,305,923
Yet there are still communities which have received a disproportionately small share of lottery funding.,503,924
We will ensure a fairer deal for them.,503,925
Labour has reshaped the lottery to match peoples priorities.,305,926
Money goes for revenue as well as capital.,408,927
"The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) directs help to education, health and the environment  after-school clubs, vital cancerbeating equipment, local green spaces.",504,928
We backed going ahead with the Dome as an opportunity to showcase British talent and give people a good day out in millennium year.,305,929
"Despite being enjoyed by more than six million visitors, the Dome did not fulfil expectations and we have learned the lessons, good and bad, from it.",305,930
But the development of the Dome has been the catalyst for unlocking the value of the North Greenwich peninsula and regenerating local communities.,503,931
"We need a revolution in the status, standards and focus of our public services.",504,932
Labour is prepared to make the investment in staff and services  and we are ready to match investment with reform.,701,933
"by raising standards and investing more in education, from nursery schools to adult learning",706,935
by giving the majority of young adults the opportunity to study in higher education,706,936
"by tackling youth unemployment, with the New Deal made permanent",706,937
"by opportunities to train as you work, through modern apprenticeships and the right to time off to study",411,938

"We have a ten-year vision for an active welfare state: to promote work for those who can, security for those who cannot, and rewards for those who save, volunteer, learn or train.",504,952
"Since 1997, we have cut the costs of unemployment, saving £4 billion last year.",305,953
"As a result, we have been able to spend more on tackling poverty and raising family support within a social security budget that has grown, in Labours first term, at the lowest rate since 1948.",305,954
"After years of mass unemployment, full employment is now on the agenda.",701,956
Our ten-year goal is to sustain a higher percentage of people in work than ever before.,701,957
"With more than one million more people in work than in 1997, and a million vacancies in the economy, we need to extend the New Deal, not abolish it as the Conservatives propose.",305,958
We judge our society by how we treat the young and the old.,706,959
"In this Parliament, over one million children have been taken out of poverty; our ten-year goal is to halve child poverty, ending it in a generation.",706,960
We will transform support for children to achieve it.,706,961
"For those in retirement, security depends on partnership between state and funded provision.",706,962

That is our promise.,301,966
"With Labour, the welfare state helps people into work, makes work pay, supports them at work, and demands responsibilities in return.",305,968
Our ambition is full employment in every region  good for the economy and good for social justice.,305,969
"The New Deal has already helped to cut longterm youth unemployment by 75 per cent  280,000 young people have been helped into work.",305,970
Long-term unemployment is down by over 60 per cent.,305,971
The claimant count is the lowest for 25 years.,305,972
But too many people are still denied the opportunity to work.,701,973
"A million people remain unemployed; 100,000 lone parents have come off income support since 1997, but our target is to raise the current 50 per cent employment rate to 70 per cent.",701,974

"We now need to build on its success, extending it to more people across the country.",701,979
We also need to ensure that the barriers to work are pulled down by delivering on our obligation to tackle discrimination so that all people can make the most of their talents.,705,980
"The benefits system we inherited was fragmented, complex and contradictory.",305,982
"We are putting in place clear, consistent rules: those who can work should be in work or in contact with the labour market.",701,983
"As unemployment falls, we need further reform to help people into work.",701,984

"We will build on the lessons of the Choices programme, which offers help with learning, work and childcare.",706,999
"Partners of unemployed people with children, like those without children, will also be asked to interviews to discuss their options.",706,1000
Parents need good-quality and affordable childcare if they are to have real choice about work.,706,1001
"For the first time, Britain has a National Childcare Strategy  covering cost, provision and quality.",706,1002
"We have already created 300,000 extra childcare places.",706,1003
By 2004 our target is to have childcare places for 1.6 million children.,706,1004
"Our vision is ambitious: safe and reliable childcare nationwide, allowing all parents to combine home and work, confident in the childcare they have chosen.",706,1005
"We will help with the costs of childcare through the Childcare Tax Credit  and will look to extend it to people looking after children with disabilities, and shift workers.",706,1006
We will support the commitment of community and voluntary groups to build up a diverse range of childcare  from Early Excellence Centres to neighbourhood nurseries and informal care (see World-class public services).,706,1007
Many older workers now want to continue in work full- or part-time.,706,1008
Yet one in three people between 50 and state pension age is not working.,701,1009
To help them we will build on the New Deal 50+.,701,1010
"To help bridge the divide between work and retirement, we will examine ways to ensure that people will be able to draw on their occupational pension and continue to work parttime for the same employer, phasing their retirement without compromising their pension.",701,1011
We are exploring how to facilitate the transition from work to positive voluntary activity.,701,1012
"Our ambition of full employment is part of a deal: if you put in a fair days work, the government will ensure you are able to support yourself and your family.",701,1013
The minimum wage is the foundation.,408,1014
But we offer a guarantee of take-home pay too.,408,1015

"For those on low incomes without children we will create an Employment Tax Credit to boost their earnings, tackle poverty and improve work incentives.",402,1017
Our ambition is to enable people with disabilities to play a full part in the community.,705,1019
The Disability Rights Commission now ensures full civil rights for people with disabilities; we have legislated so those with special needs or disabilities have equal access to education.,705,1020
"We are now committed to extending basic rights and opportunities, as indicated in our response to the Disability Rights Taskforce.",705,1021
"We are requiring different kinds of public transport to be made accessible, and introducing concessionary bus fares for the first time, for people with disabilities.",705,1022
The New Deal for Disabled People pioneers new ways of helping people with disabilities into jobs.,705,1023
The opportunity to work is vital to civil rights; we are testing how best to offer help with rehabilitation and job retention.,705,1024
"We will invest an additional £40 million to help people with disabilities into work, ensure that it is worthwhile to try out a job and stay in work if they have high care costs, and improve assessment for equipment and services as people move in and out of work.",705,1025
We will not use disability benefits to disguise unemployment  the Tory approach in the 1980s.,305,1026
"The number of people getting Incapacity Benefit (IB) has fallen by 11 per cent since 1997; but too many people are written off when in fact they could, with support, work.",705,1027
We will help break down the barriers that keep people with disabilities out of work.,705,1028
"We will continue to modernise the operation of the benefits system so that, if people can work, we help them to do so, and stop them slipping from lack of work to inability to work.",705,1029
Around 18 million working days are lost each year due to work-related illness  at a cost of over £17 billion.,504,1030
"Many people on Industrial Injuries Benefit are helped into work by combining support with effective services, and we want to help as many of the rest as possible.",705,1031
But if people cannot work society has a duty to provide security for them.,504,1032
"For people unable to take up paid work, we are committed to offer security.",504,1033
We have increased support for children with parents on income support by 80 per cent in real terms since 1997.,305,1034
There is now a minimum income guarantee of £142 per week for people with disabilities under 60.,305,1035
Incapacity Benefit has been extended to people disabled from a young age.,305,1036
Disability Living Allowance has been extended to three- and four-year-olds.,305,1037
We will continue to keep the system under review.,504,1038
Our first priority has been to work with local authorities to drive up administrative standards and tackle fraud and error.,605,1041
But we must continue to reform it.,504,1042
"So we will simplify housing benefit and its administration, distinguishing between people of working age and pensioners, reforming provision for private tenants, and examining the case for longer awards.",504,1043
We will spread best practice in administration.,504,1044
"In the longer term, we will build on our restructuring of rents to ensure that for people of working age, housing benefit as well as the Working Families Tax Credit strengthen work incentives.",504,1045
Strong and stable family life offers the best possible start to children.,603,1047
And marriage provides a strong foundation for stable relationships.,603,1048
The government supports marriage.,603,1049
But it has to do more than that.,603,1050
"It must support families, above all families with children.",603,1051
Our vision of the tax and benefits system for families with children is to provide help for all families; to give most help at the time families need it most; and to give more help to those families most in need.,402,1052
The Conservatives stacked the tax system against families: over four million children lived in poverty; one in five children were growing up in households without work; the average income of households with children had fallen to 30 per cent below the level for those without children.,305,1053
Labour has started to turn this round.,305,1054
We have raised child benefit for the first child by over a quarter.,305,1055
The Working Families Tax Credit has meant a tax cut averaging £31 per week for 1.1 million families.,305,1056
"In 2001-02, an average of nearly £500 above 1997-98 levels will be invested in every child in Britain.",305,1057
"Personal tax and benefit changes have made families with children an average of £1,000 a year better off.",305,1058
We are pledged to go further  to eradicate child poverty in a generation and halve it by 2010.,706,1059
In the next Parliament we will make major changes.,402,1060
"The Childrens Tax Credit  the family tax cut  is worth up to £520 a year for five million families, with half a million families removed from paying tax altogether.",402,1061
"It is paid until one parent earns more than £40,000 per year.",402,1062
"From 2003, the Integrated Child Credit will bring together all existing income-related payments for children, providing most help to the neediest children, building on the foundation of universal child benefit.",402,1063
"With the new system of child support, every family will receive at least £15 per week, and those most in need £50 per week  over £2,500 per year.",504,1064
"For the first time, Britain will have a seamless system of child support, whether parents are in or out of work, paid to the main carer.",504,1065
Our aim is to make the goal of ending child poverty in Britain a political litmus test for any political party running for office.,706,1066
The task for the next Parliament is to help another million children out of poverty.,706,1067
"Our active welfare state has so far been based on work, finance and services.",305,1069
It is now time to add a fourth pillar to the welfare state  a programme to extend to all children the advantages that come from reaching adulthood backed by a financial nest-egg.,408,1070
Nearly a third of individuals have no financial savings or assets at all.,701,1071
"People without assets are much more likely to have lower earnings and higher unemployment, and are less likely to start a business or enter higher education.",701,1072
The government already encourages people to save for a rainy day and save for a pension.,408,1073
We are determined to extend the savings habit to more people.,408,1074
But we are pledged also to use saving to promote opportunity for the next generation.,706,1075
"All newly born children will have an interestbearing Child Trust Fund set up in their name with an initial endowment from the government, with more for poorer children.",706,1076
The endowment will be locked until the child reaches adulthood.,706,1077
We will provide incentives for extended family and friends as well as parents to contribute to the fund.,706,1078
"All the next generation will have the backing of a real financial asset to invest in learning, buying a home or setting up a business.",706,1079
Labour supports a national childrens rights director to act as a champion for children in need and we will consult on whether to develop and extend the directors role.,706,1084
The Criminal Records Bureau will help stop paedophiles and others who are a danger to children from working with them.,605,1085
"From next year, all childrens homes will, for the first time, be subject to independent spot checks.",605,1086
The level of educational attainment of children in care will be significantly increased.,506,1087
"Every child leaving care will be guaranteed access to a job, training or education.",706,1088
"For many children in care, adoption offers the best chance of success in life.",706,1089
We will make adoption faster and fairer.,706,1090
Children who need new families will be placed within 12 months by 2004.,706,1091
"We aim to ensure that at least 1,000 more children a year are adopted, with improved post-adoption support for parents.",706,1092
But we want to go further  with government funding to help parents devote more time to their children early in life.,706,1096
"We want government to promote choice because, without our help, many people are denied the choices that should be theirs.",706,1097
A flexible labour market must work to the benefit of both employers and employees.,701,1098
Statutory maternity leave is currently 18 weeks; we propose to increase it to six months.,504,1099
"Statutory maternity pay is paid at a flat rate of £60 a week; we propose to increase it to £100 per week, as big an increase in the next two years as in the past 40 years.",504,1100
"Fathers currently have no legal right to paid time off on the birth of a child; we propose to introduce it for two weeks, also paid at £100 per week.",504,1101
We need to do more to help parents balance work and family.,603,1102
"Many parents, especially mothers, want to work reduced hours when they do go back to work.",603,1103
We will work with business and employees to combine flexible working with the needs of business.,701,1104
Some families break up.,603,1106
Governments role is to ensure that both parents retain responsibility for the financial support of their children where they are able to do so.,603,1107
"We have always supported the principle underlying the work of the Child Support Agency (CSA), but the Conservatives bungled its introduction.",305,1108
That is why we have already legislated to reform the CSA and these improvements will come on stream from 2002.,603,1109
"A simple system will ensure a better deal for children, that fathers pay a fair share, that mothers benefit from their doing so, and that tougher action is taken against parents who do not comply.",603,1110
In 1997 Labour made a clear commitment to ensure pensioners share fairly in the rising prosperity of the nation.,305,1112
"At this election, we repeat our commitment to pensioners  we honour your lifetime of work by ensuring that you share fairly in the nations rising prosperity, and are committed to tackling pensioner poverty.",706,1113
We will build a secure system on the foundation of the basic state pension.,706,1114
"As a result of Labours policies, in this Parliament spending on pensioners will be £4.5 billion a year more in real terms than in 1997.",305,1115
"Of this, £2 billion is going to the poorest third of pensioners.",305,1116
"Our first priority was to help those on lowest incomes: we have lifted the incomes of the 1.7 million poorest pensioners by at least £800 a year, and for some couples by up to £1,400.",305,1117
Pensioner households are on average £11 per week better off than they were in 1997; and over three million pensioner households benefit from free TV licences for those over-75s.,305,1118
The pensioners tax allowance means six out of ten pensioners pay no tax.,305,1119
We have halved the rate of tax they pay on savings income.,305,1120
We have pledged to extend tax allowances further so that by 2003 no pensioner pays tax until their income reaches £127 per week.,305,1121
We now need to go further.,305,1122
"With Labour, the basic state pension will rise by 2003 to £77 a week for a single pensioner and £123 a week for a pensioner couple.",504,1123
"We guarantee that the Minimum Income Guarantee will be uprated each year in line with earnings, throughout the next Parliament.",504,1124
"In 2003, this will mean no single pensioner will have an income below £100 per week and no pensioner couple an income below £154 per week.",706,1125
Labour introduced the Winter Fuel Payment.,305,1126
Last winter it was raised to £200.,305,1128
For next winter it will also be £200.,504,1129
We will also do more to reward pensioners who have saved.,706,1130
"Pensioners who work and save will find, for the first time ever, the government rewarding their saving.",706,1131
Pensioner couples with an income up to £200 per week and single pensioners with income up to £135 per week will be rewarded for saving  the government adding up to 60p for each £1 of savings income up to a maximum of £23.,706,1132
"In the process, we will abolish the weekly means test for pensioners, along with removing the unfair test of savings, which penalises pensioners who have modest savings and whose thrift should be recognised.",706,1133
It is also vital to have in place long-term pension reform.,414,1134
We support a fair balance of public and private provision.,414,1135
"Occupational and personal pensions, properly regulated, will continue to offer security for middle and high earners.",414,1136
We will continue discussions on annuity reform to ensure tax rules do not unnecessarily restrict the development of annuity products and markets.,414,1137
"For low- to middle-income earners, stakeholder pensions cap costs, guarantee value for money, offer flexibility, and drive down fees across the board.",414,1138
"And for the lowest paid and carers, full-time parents and people with disabilities, the state second pension will top up their pension contributions to give a decent pension in retirement to 18 million people.",705,1139
Labours NHS Plan offers £1. 4 billion of investment for older people to promote better health and support independence.,504,1141
"Pensioners also need simple, accessible services that treat them with dignity and promote independence.",706,1142
"We will build on Care Direct to provide a better integration of health, housing, benefits and social care for older people.",706,1143
This will be an integrated third age service to help older people and those who care for them.,706,1144
"Not only are the large majority of people who require care older, but also the majority of carers are older people.",706,1146
Labour will tackle the problems faced by people requiring care and the problems of carers themselves.,706,1147
"The national carers strategy is the first step, with information, support and care for carers: Labour will spend £500 million over the next three years providing financial support for 300,000 carers through the benefits system, and £255 million for social care services for carers.",504,1148
"More is being done for carers through income support; carers will be better able to combine work and care; and 75,000 more carers each year are now able to take a break from their caring responsibilites.",706,1149
"We are proud that, with Labour, care by qualified nurses will be made free to all, wherever it is received.",504,1150
One hundred and fifty thousand more older people will receive rehabilitation and convalescence through growing investment in the NHS and social services that the Tories refuse to match.,504,1151
We want to see carers given access to the cash and services appropriate to their service to their relatives and the community.,706,1152
The Carers and Disabled Childrens Act gives carers a right to an independent assessment of their needs.,706,1153
We will examine the development of a fund to help local authorities produce tailored care packages to back up the results of these assessments.,706,1154
"Before 1997, social exclusion was ignored.",305,1157
"Now we have a new approach  improving the quality of mainstream services, preventing people falling between the cracks, and reintegrating them into society if things go wrong.",503,1158
The number of people living on the streets is down by one third since 1997.,305,1161
Labours target is to cut rough sleeping to two-thirds of its 1998 level by 2002.,706,1162
"Beyond then, we will maintain the drive to keep the number as low as possible.",706,1163
"Labours strategy tackles the causes of teenage pregnancy, provides mothers under 18 with access to supervised housing if they cannot live at home, and ensures that, if they do have children, teenagers get access to training, education or work.",706,1166
By 2004 we are pledged to reduce teenage pregnancy by 15 per cent.,706,1167
Labour has a target of reducing truancy and exclusion by a third by 2002.,605,1169
"The police are conducting truancy sweeps; parents are now subject to fines of up to £2,500; funds are being targeted towards pupils at risk.",605,1170
"Nearly ten per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds are not in education, training or work.",706,1172
"The new Connexions service will bridge the gap, providing a single adviser to ensure all young people receive clear advice on the transition to work.",706,1173
"Over the next three years Labour is pledged to back reform, with £900 million of investment in deprived neighbourhoods.",504,1175
"We want local people to lead renewal  a coalition of public, private and voluntary organisations specifying priorities, engaging local effort.",301,1176
"Local Strategic Partnerships, which we have introduced to help coordinate public service improvement, will be properly inclusive of local people, involving them in decision-making.",301,1177
They will be backed by specific funds to engage the local community.,504,1178
"Nearly £100 million has been set aside for business start-ups, and we will create a new tax credit for community investment to create £1 billion of investment in disadvantaged areas.",402,1179
Labours objective is to get the right benefit to the right people at the right time.,504,1181
We want those entitled to benefits to take up their rights to claim them.,504,1182
"Fraud undermines confidence in the welfare system, so we are committed to reduce it.",605,1183
"We have been prepared to be tough  preventing fraud by tightening gateways, sharpening sanctions on fraudsters, and now with two-strikes-and-youre-out.",605,1184
We have saved £1 billion in fraud and error over the course of the Parliament by tightening up the way we administer income support.,605,1185
The introduction of Automated Credit Transfer will save a further £100 million per year.,504,1186
"Labour is committed to clear targets for fraud reduction for each benefit, including a commitment to halve the rate of fraud and error in income support and Job Seekers Allowance by 2006, and to incorporate fraud prevention into the design of new policies on benefits and tax credits.",605,1187
We are also committed to data sharing between government agencies and action to reduce to a minimum the number of spare national insurance numbers that are a gateway to fraud.,605,1188
"Our welfare state is underpinned by clear values  we help you to help yourself, we invest in children, we support our pensioners, we insist that no community be written off, and we minimise fraud and error.",504,1189
Our reforms will build a strong and inclusive society.,603,1190
"by boosting the basic state pension for a single pensioner to £77 each week in 2003, £123 for couples",504,1192
"by retaining the Winter Fuel Payment, and free TV licences for over-75s",504,1193
by rewarding those who save with the Pension Credit,706,1194
by raising the Minimum Income Guarantee to £100 each week (£154 for couples) in 2003,706,1195
by tackling discrimination against over-50s in health care and in the workplace,706,1196
"by boosting police numbers and cutting overall crime, and crimes like burglary that affect senior citizens most",605,1197
"- Halve the burglary rate and double the chance of a persistent offender being caught and punished, as we modernise the criminal justice system.",605,1200
"- Reformed local government with higher-quality services, as we decentralise power.",301,1201
"- An extra 6,000 police recruits raising police numbers to their highest ever level.",605,1203
- Double the amount of assets seized from drug traffickers and other major criminals.,605,1204
- Increased sentences plus education and drug treatment for persistent offenders.,605,1205
- A bill of rights for victims.,605,1206
- New freedoms with new targets for local government.,605,1207
"We have a ten-year vision: a new social contract where everyone has a stake based on equal rights, where they pay their dues by exercising responsibility in return, and where local communities shape their own futures.",503,1209
"Overall crime is down ten per cent in Labour Britain, recorded crime down seven per cent, and police numbers are now rising.",605,1210
Our strategy is clear and consistent  tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.,605,1211
"Our ten-year goal of reducing crime depends on reform of the criminal justice system at every level, from police to courts to prison  to put crime reduction centre stage.",605,1212
"And, because crime is changing, crime fighting has to change too  to tackle repeat offending, drug-related crime and organised crime.",605,1213
We are investing to raise police numbers to their highest level ever.,605,1214
Offenders must know they will be supervised in or out of prison until they can prove they have gone straight.,605,1215
"Our purpose is simple: to create a Britain that is democratic, decentralised and diverse, with decisions always taken as close to the people as is consistent with efficiency and equity.",301,1218
"Our ten-year goal is a new settlement with local government  over finance, structures and services.",301,1219
"Recorded crime doubled under the Conservatives: burglary went up 105 per cent, car crime 110 per cent, violent crime 182 per cent.",305,1221
"The number of offenders caught, convicted and punished fell.",305,1222
"The criminal justice system, especially for young offenders, was in disarray.",305,1223
Anti-social behaviour was unchecked.,305,1224
And investment was falling.,305,1225
"The British Crime Survey shows crime down ten per cent in Labours first two and a half years, including a four per cent drop in violent crime.",305,1226
"Recorded crime is down seven per cent from 1997, domestic burglary down 28 per cent, car crime down 20 per cent.",305,1227
Investment in crime fighting is up.,305,1228
"We have reversed the declining trend in police numbers, reformed youth justice, and supported every community to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour.",305,1229
"We have reduced by seven weeks the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders, and are on track to meet our pledge to halve the time by May 2002.",305,1230
But we are not satisfied.,305,1231
Drug-related crime is a menace.,305,1232
"Recorded violent crime has risen, partly because more domestic and racial violence is being reported.",305,1233
"And new crimes are being committed  fraud through the internet, human trafficking.",305,1234
The only way to reduce crime is by being tough on crime and tough on its causes.,605,1235
Government can help families and communities prevent crime.,605,1236
"But when people do commit crimes, we need an effective criminal justice system able to catch, punish and rehabilitate people.",605,1237
Police numbers started falling in 1993.,305,1240
"Our investment in 2000-01 increased the number of recruits by an extra 3,000, boosting the number of officers in training by 77 per cent over the previous year.",305,1241
"Now Labour pledges a further 6,000 extra recruits.",605,1242
"Labours pledge is that over the next three years annual funding for the police will rise by £1.6 billion, to £9.3 billion.",605,1243
We also need to create a more effective police service.,605,1244
"Basic command units are the heart of modern policing, and local commanders and senior detectives should be properly trained and rewarded.",605,1245
"Strong leadership, modern equipment and specialist training and expertise are all essential.",605,1246
We will bring in new arrangements for the development and appointment of chief officers.,605,1247
We will introduce a new national core curriculum for officers at every level.,605,1248
We will ensure that specialist detective expertise is built up using outside experts where necessary.,605,1249
Labour will ensure more people see more police in the community.,305,1250
"We will discuss with the police how those on the frontline might be rewarded for their skills, experience and commitment.",605,1251
We will promote co-operation across force boundaries for common services like training.,605,1252
We are also committed to a new independent police complaints commission.,605,1253
"About 100,000 persistent offenders, mostly young men, commit about half of all serious crimes.",605,1255
" Youth offending teams will track up to 2,500 of the most persistent young offenders 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",605,1257
 Every active offender will be on the DNA database by 2004.,605,1258
 Persistent offending should lead to increased punishment.,605,1259
"We will end the failed policy of repeat financial penalties; where offending continues, firmer measures will be taken.",605,1260
We will invest over £200 million over three years to reduce reoffending by those in custody.,605,1261
"Sentences will combine time in prison and in the community, with proper supervision after release for ex-prisoners.",605,1262
"In time, all offenders will have their own plan for return to lawful life, starting in custody with drug treatment or literacy training.",605,1263
" New Review Courts will ensure that offenders who breach the conditions of their sentence will get extra community service, more intensive supervision or custody.",605,1264
Those who break their bail can expect to go straight into custody for the remainder of their remand period.,605,1265
 To deal with the most dangerous offenders of all  those with a dangerous severe personality disorder  we will pass new legislation and create over 300 more high-security prison and hospital places.,605,1266
stay straight or you will stay supervised or go back inside.,605,1268
"The continued modernisation of the probation, parole and prison services, so every offender gets punishment designed to minimise reoffending, will carry this forward.",605,1269
We will build on our youth justice reforms to improve the standard of custodial accommodation and offending programmes for 18- to 20-year-old offenders.,605,1270
"Broken windows, graffiti and litter all send a signal about lawlessness.",605,1272
Labour supports fines for anti-social behaviour and new powers to tackle unruly behaviour and kerb crawlers.,605,1273
Every local authority should have an anti-social behaviour unit.,605,1274
"We will tackle alcohol-related disorder, with an overhaul of licensing laws, greater flexibility over opening times, and tougher controls on rogue landlords.",605,1275
We will also streamline the system for removal of untaxed and abandoned cars.,605,1276
Crime fighting now starts in every community thanks to new statutory Crime and Disorder Partnerships.,605,1277
Our Safe Communities Fund will target hundreds of neighbourhoods with the highest crime rates with extra crime-fighting investment.,605,1278
"Domestic violence accounts for at least a quarter of all violent crime, so Labour is committed to expanding the safe hostel network.",605,1279
"Crime prevention requires that those most at risk of falling into a life of crime  children excluded from school, teenagers leaving care  are given real help and opportunity.",706,1280
"That includes drugs education for every child at primary and secondary school, and youth inclusion schemes in high-crime areas.",706,1281
We will also take measures to tackle the problem of child pornography on the internet.,605,1282
One of the biggest contemporary drivers of crime is drugs.,605,1284
Access to effective treatment is essential.,605,1285
"Prisoners are already subject to compulsory testing and offered treatment where necessary, which has led to a 50 per cent cut in the number testing positive.",605,1286
Drug Testing and Treatment Orders ensure people punished in the community stay drug-free.,605,1287
We are pledged to raise spending on drug treatment by 70 per cent by 2004.,605,1288
We will roll out drug testing to cover offenders at every stage of the system.,605,1289
People in prison for drug-related offences will have to kick the habit before they are free from supervision on the outside.,605,1290
Drug dealers will be required to register with the police after leaving prison.,605,1291
We will simplify the law on extradition to target organised crime including drug traffickers.,605,1292
The Criminal Assets Recovery Agency will target their ill-gotten gains.,605,1293
"We will follow the money trail, through bureaux de change to offshore accounts, to convict them, and remove their money and passports.",605,1294
Our ambition is to mobilise every neighbourhood against drugs.,605,1295
"We will therefore ensure that crime-fighting partnerships, covering every locality, get over £200 million over the next three years to fight crime and drugs.",605,1296
The UKs legal traditions are precious.,605,1298
But too much of our criminal law and the organisation of the courts are stuck in the past.,605,1299
"Our ambition is to re-equip the criminal justice system to deliver justice for all  the victims, the public and the defendant, with a short-term target of 100,000 more crimes ending in a criminal brought to justice.",605,1300
Our White Paper Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead set out our initial views on reform.,605,1301
The Auld enquiry will also make major recommendations.,605,1302
"Despite an increase of 25 per cent since 1997, we have too few prosecutors.",605,1304
"By 2004, Labour pledges 300 new prosecutors, including specialists in areas like serious and organised crime, paid on a level playing field with the defence.",605,1305
We will modernise and consolidate the whole criminal law system to promote public confidence and to speed up criminal proceedings.,605,1306
Law reform is necessary to make provisions against corporate manslaughter.,605,1307
"The current system, split between magistrates and crown courts, needs reform.",605,1309
"A unified system, including lower or intermediate tiers of court, offers simplicity and flexibility.",605,1310
Lay magistrates as well as professional judges have their place in the system.,605,1311
We will remove the widely abused right of defendants alone to dictate whether or not they should be tried in crown court.,605,1312
"For specialist cases such as those involving domestic violence or fraud, there is a strong case for specialist courts and specialist judges.",605,1313
"We will also develop late sitting, sevenday- a-week courts in high-crime areas to ensure there is no delay in getting people through the criminal justice system.",605,1314
"We have established a Judicial Commissioner to scrutinise the appointments process, and will take forward reform on the basis of experience.",605,1315
Our rules of evidence fail to trust the good sense of judges and jurors.,605,1317
Recent case law has extended the admissibility of evidence of previous conduct.,605,1318
"If there is any remaining doubt, we will consider legislation to reinforce the judgment.",605,1319
"Pending the findings of the Auld report, we see a strong case for a new presumption that would allow evidence of previous convictions where relevant.",605,1320
Currently only the prosecution must disclose all expert evidence and names of all witnesses.,605,1321
"In the light of the Auld report, we will consider whether the defence should do so too.",605,1322
"In addition, witnesses should be able to refer to their original statements in the witness box, as well as offer evidence by video-link.",605,1323
We have created the Community Legal Service and will extend it to 90 per cent of the population by April 2002.,605,1325
We will continue to pursue the principle of best value for the benefit of the taxpayer and criminal defendants in the Criminal Defence Service.,605,1326
We will examine reforms of the tribunal system in the light of the Leggatt Review.,605,1327
We will subject restrictive practices in the legal professions to the closest scrutiny to ensure both the professions and the courts serve the wider public interest.,605,1328
"In 1997, victims were the forgotten people in legal battles.",706,1330
That has begun to change.,706,1331
"We have more than doubled the funding for Victim Support, taken powers to protect vulnerable witnesses in court, and prevented personal cross-examination by the defendant of rape victims.",706,1332
We now propose further action.,706,1333
"First, victims will be given the legal right to present their views on the impact of the crime to the court and other criminal justice agencies before sentencing decisions.",706,1334
"Second, prosecutors will be able to challenge defence pleas in mitigation of the crime.",706,1335
"Third, we will legislate for a Victims Bill of Rights to give support, protection, and rights to information and compensation to victims.",706,1336
"Labour believes that Britain can be a model of a multicultural, multi-racial society.",607,1338
We have made major legal change; now is the time to build the inclusive society in tune with British values.,607,1339
Our commitment to protection for every citizen is expressed in the 1998 Human Rights Act.,503,1340
It ensures that British citizens are able to enforce rights in our own courts.,503,1341
Other legal change was necessary too.,503,1342
The Race Relations (Amendment) Act learns the legal lessons from the shocking death of Stephen Lawrence and places a positive duty on all public bodies to promote equal opportunity.,503,1343
"We abhor racism and shall continue to implement the recommendations of the Macpherson report, including the reform of the double jeopardy law for murder.",503,1344
The repeal of Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act was grossly misrepresented as an attempt to use teaching to promote particular lifestyles.,503,1345
"We will ensure that such teaching continues to be prohibited, based on the provisions of the Learning and Skills Act, while removing discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.",503,1346
The UK now has the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in Europe.,503,1347
"But an inclusive, tolerant, open society, where people rise on their merits, depends on culture and action as well as law.",503,1348
"We now need to reduce the barriers  to services, opportunities, institutions  that still hold people back.",503,1349
This applies in the public and private sectors.,503,1350
"There are too few black and Asian staff in key public services and, in almost all organisations, far too few in middle and senior grades.",503,1351
This is why we now have targets for the diversity of central government and other public services.,503,1352
Voluntary and community organisations are key to Labours vision for Britain.,606,1353
"From large national charities to local community groups and faith-based institutions, these sectors are a vital and diverse part of national life.",606,1354
"We have changed the tax rules to encourage individuals and businesses to give to charity, supported initiatives to increase volunteering, involved voluntary and community groups in the design and delivery of key government programmes like Sure Start, and helped charities build up their capacity to do their job even better.",606,1355
"Labour will build on its Compact with the voluntary sector, as we develop more farreaching partnerships for the delivery of services and the renewal of our communities.",606,1356
"We will also build on our financial incentives for volunteering, by developing an effective infrastructure to support voluntary work in every community in Britain.",606,1357
We welcome the contribution of churches and other faith-based organisations as partners of local and central government in community renewal.,606,1358
We will use a successor to the Lambeth Group to look at governments interface with faith communities.,606,1359
People from abroad make a positive contribution to British society.,705,1361
"As our economy changes and expands, so our rules on immigration need to reflect the need to meet skills shortages.",705,1362
"The primary purpose rule, which split families and did nothing to stop abuse, has been ended.",705,1363
A right of appeal for family visitors has been introduced.,705,1364
"immigration rules will remain clear, firm and fair, and help ensure that those who come and work here continue to make a major contribution to our economic and social life.",705,1365
It is right that people fleeing persecution are able to make a new life as hard-working citizens in a new country.,705,1367
"Britain has a long record of providing a home for such people, and it is important that we maintain this position.",705,1368
But asylum should not be an alternative route to immigration.,705,1369
The UK is ninth per head of population among European nations for asylum applications.,705,1370
The key is to hear cases swiftly as well as fairly.,705,1371
"By cutting the decision time and increasing the processing of claims to over 10,000 a month, Labour has reduced the backlog we inherited.",305,1372
"We have tightened controls against traffickers, and introduced a civil penalty for lorry drivers who bring in illegal immigrants.",605,1373
A national support system has been introduced to relieve pressure on local authorities.,504,1374
"Asylum seekers and their dependants whose claims are rejected will be removed from Britain with the aim of more than 30,000 in 2003-04.",705,1375
"We will also help those granted refugee status to integrate into the local community, supporting them so they can come off benefits and into work.",705,1376
We support tough penalties for those who engage in the barbaric trade of human trafficking.,605,1377
We will bring forward proposals to ensure a common interpretation of the 1951 Convention across the EU and to improve the international response to regional crises.,108,1378
Labours ambition is a partnership of mutual respect and mutual responsibility.,305,1385
"We want to combine additional rights and resources with responsibility and reform, working with councillors and officers to develop the structures, services and finance to help local communities.",704,1386
"The job of local government is to provide the leadership to improve quality of life, and offer the citizen a seamless, one-stop service.",504,1387
We have worked with local government to establish clear targets for standards of service; and to offer incentives for service improvement and innovation.,504,1388
Partnership with the voluntary and private sectors is key.,505,1389
The foundation of effective service delivery is best value in every service.,504,1390
"Year on year, local authorities and their staff will now work to achieve improvement in services, matching themselves against the best.",504,1391
Citizens need a voice  we will work with local government to ensure that citizens needs are the driving force in the procurement and delivery of local services.,504,1392
"Electronic service delivery offers the prospect of greater convenience, access and quality, and we have set demanding targets for its use.",411,1393
"When public services are delivered in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors, this should be on the basis of best value not worst labour standards.",505,1394
The TUPE regulations protect the rights of any transferred employees.,701,1395
Newly hired workers are protected by minimum standards at work.,701,1396
We will use a wide-ranging review of TUPE regulations to consider whether unfair disparities are being created between these two groups of workers.,701,1397
We want to give successful local councils more leeway to meet local needs using a £400 million reward fund.,301,1398
We have piloted local public service agreements to offer new investment and greater financial flexibility in return for higher performance.,504,1399
We will extend this reform to all upper-tier councils.,704,1400
"We will offer further flexibility for high-performance authorities, with reformed inspections and more local discretion to encourage civic renewal.",704,1401
"We consulted last year on a range of reforms aimed at enabling councils to deliver key local services on the basis of transparent, stable and adequate funding.",704,1402
These remain our aims.,704,1403
We will give new freedoms to local authorities to enable them to invest in local capital projects.,704,1404
"Labour believes that local quality of life issues  from litter to parks  are vital issues, not peripheral.",501,1405
"We will pilot home zones, redesigning local areas to enhance safety and the quality of the local neighbourhood.",501,1406
Local authorities should have the incentive and means to improve the local environment by recycling local fines into a local environment fund.,501,1407
"Our ambition is the development of active, intouch local government, serving the people.",301,1408
"We support the introduction of elected mayors for our cities, which is why every local council now has the power to ballot citizens for a mayor.",301,1409
Economic development is the core of regional policy today.,305,1412
"In our first term, we have created RDAs to drive regional economic development.",305,1413
Regional chambers have been set up to provide some accountability for regional economic decision-making.,305,1414
"We are committed, as RDAs take on more power, to enhance the scrutiny functions of regional chambers.",301,1415
For some regions this degree of political representation will be sufficient.,301,1416
"However, in other parts of the country there may be a stronger sense of regional identity and a desire for a regional political voice.",301,1417
In 1997 we said that provision should be made for directly elected regional government to go ahead in regions where people decided in a referendum to support it and where predominantly unitary local government is established.,301,1418
This remains our commitment.,301,1419
"Devolution has strengthened the UK, preserving the union on the basis of a fairer partnership.",301,1421
The nationalist lie has also been exposed: the UK is strong enough and flexible enough to devolve power while retaining the benefits of staying together.,301,1422
The Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly have put power in the hands of local people.,301,1423
In Scotland the Parliament has power over primary legislation.,301,1424
"In Wales we will build on the already successful legislative partnership with the Assembly, and continue to enact specific legislation for Wales, where appropriate.",301,1425
The UK Parliament makes the essential financial allocations to all devolved bodies.,301,1426
"English MPs make up 85 per cent of the UK Parliament so there is no case for threatening the unity of the UK with an English Parliament or the denial of voting rights to Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irelands MPs at Westminster.",301,1427
We have made working for peace in Northern Ireland a priority.,106,1429
The Good Friday Agreement was overwhelmingly supported by the people of Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.,106,1430
"While it has not brought a perfect peace, and while the peace process has not been smooth, it has made life immeasurably better.",106,1431
Northern Ireland now has its own Assembly and Executive.,301,1432
They have produced their first programme for government and first budget on a cross-community basis.,301,1433
The security situation has been transformed.,106,1434
People can walk again on the streets of Belfast free from fear.,106,1435
Troops no longer patrol in most of the province.,106,1436
And the number of murders has been drastically reduced.,106,1437
We will build on these foundations to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full and the new institutions take root.,605,1438
"We will establish a modern, responsive and fully accountable police service properly representative of the two main traditions in Northern Ireland and enjoying their trust and support.",605,1439
And we will bring about the key reforms in the civil and criminal justice system which secure the respect and trust of both traditions.,605,1440
"The House of Commons is now more representative than ever before, yet only one in five MPs is a woman.",305,1442
Labour increased womens representation five-fold in the 1997 Parliament through all-women shortlists.,305,1443
"We are committed, through legislation, to allow each party to make positive moves to increase the representation of women.",706,1444
Labour will continue to modernise the procedures of the House of Commons so it can effectively fulfil its functions of representation and scrutiny.,303,1445
"The government has introduced major innovations in the electoral systems used in the UK  for the devolved administrations, the European Parliament, and the London Assembly.",303,1446
The Independent Commission on the Voting System made proposals for electoral reform at Westminster.,303,1447
We will review the experience of the new systems and the Jenkins report to assess whether changes might be made to the electoral system for the House of Commons.,303,1448
A referendum remains the right way to agree any change for Westminster.,303,1449
"We are committed to completing House of Lords reform, including removal of the remaining hereditary peers, to make it more representative and democratic, while maintaining the House of Commons traditional primacy.",303,1450
"We have given our support to the report and conclusions of the Wakeham Commission, and will seek to implement them in the most effective way possible.",303,1451
Labour supports modernisation of the House of Lords procedures to improve its effectiveness.,303,1452
We will put the independent Appointments Commission on a statutory footing.,303,1453
Our civil service is world-renowned for its independence.,303,1455
Labour is committed to maintaining the political impartiality of the civil service.,303,1456
But it needs reform to make it more effective and more entrepreneurial.,303,1457
There have been important reforms already.,303,1458
We want to take further radical steps to ensure the civil service has the skills base necessary to meet the challenges set out in this manifesto.,303,1459
"Equal rights for all, proper enforcement of the law, and reformed structures of self-government: these are the foundations of a strong civic society.",503,1460
Labour offers opportunity with responsibility  the right combination for Britain in the 21st century.,305,1461
"by increasing police funding by 20 per cent over the next three years, and taking police numbers to record levels",605,1463
"by targeting investment on fighting crime in the highest-risk areas and tough targets to reduce car crimes, burglaries and robberies",605,1464
by cracking down on local disorder and anti-social behaviour through local partnerships and measures to deal with the yob culture,605,1465
"by implementing our ten-year strategy to tackle drugs, including tougher punishments for dealers",605,1466
by reforming the criminal justice system to deal with persistent offenders and ensuring the victims of crime have a greater say,605,1467
by tackling the causes of crime through measures like the New Deal and action on truancy,605,1468
"Europe to have the most competitive knowledge-based economies in the world, as British ideas lead a reformed and enlarged Europe.",108,1471
"Delivering Kyoto and international development targets, as we help tackle climate change and global poverty.",107,1472
- Lead economic reform in Europe.,108,1474
- Work for the re-start of world trade talks.,107,1475
"- Strong, effective and responsive armed forces.",104,1476
- Raise international aid towards the UN target.,107,1477
- Be the first country to introduce greenhouse gas trading to cut pollution.,501,1478
"We have a ten-year vision for British foreign policy: a leading player in Europe, our alliance with the USA strengthened, using our global connections to help Britain and tackle global problems.",107,1480
"Unlike the Conservatives, we see Europe as an opportunity not a threat.",305,1481
"Because we participate fully, we are able to work with our partners to shape an EU agenda that advances our national interests.",108,1482
We will put democratically elected national governments in the driving seat of EU policy.,108,1483
Our ten-year goal is to work with our partners for Europe to have the most competitive knowledge-based economies in the world.,108,1484
We hold to our promise: no membership of the single currency without the consent of the British people in a referendum.,202,1485
"With Labour, they are being developed to meet the challenges of the post-Cold War world.",305,1487
Labour is committed to lead the development of a comprehensive agenda for poverty reduction and sustainable development.,107,1488
"We want to mobilise the international community to deliver the International Development Targets, generate growth and equity in developing countries, and help them benefit from global economic integration.",107,1489
We are convinced of the science of global warming.,501,1490
"We pledge to meet tough national targets for environmental protection, and we will work at international level to halt and reverse climate change.",501,1491
We face a choice between an inward-looking chauvinism that leads to isolation and a modern patriotism where the British national interest is pursued through international engagement.,305,1492
"Do we want to be part of the change, influencing its direction? Or do we want to opt out? We have spent 50 years on the margins; it is time to make the most of our membership.",108,1500
We have seen the alternative.,305,1501
"By 1997 Britain had retreated into itself: business was global, people travelled and worked around the world, our culture was open to new ideas, yet our government was closing itself off.",305,1502
And Britain got a worse deal.,305,1503
"Because they were backward looking and divided on Europe, the Conservatives were weak and ineffective in Europe.",305,1504
"And because of their weakness in Europe, Britain lost influence around the world.",305,1505
We lost our say over decisions that affected our lives.,305,1506
In the last four years we have seen the benefits of engagement.,305,1507
Our rebate has been protected and our contributions are falling to similar levels as France and Italy.,305,1508
The Labour model of defence co-operation  giving Europe the option to act where NATO chooses not to  has won through.,305,1509
Economic reform is now helping the European economy.,305,1510
"The veto on crucial issues of national sovereignty, such as tax, is safe.",305,1511
"All this happened only because Labour had the strength to get involved, argue for its ideas, and persuade others to follow us.",305,1512
"Labour believes that Europe brings benefits for Britain, and a Europe reformed by British ideas, working with our MEPs, will be even better for Britain.",305,1513
Together with virtually all other European countries we do not support a United States of Europe.,108,1514
"But we do believe a Europe made up of nation states and offering a unique blend of inter-governmental co-operation where possible and integration where necessary, can be a major force for good  for its own members and in the wider world.",108,1515
"We want to take Europe forward, to meet British needs.",108,1516
"Europe is a crucial market, accounting for more than half of our trade.",108,1518
Britain has secured a shift in economic policy in Europe  away from harmonisation of rules and towards a system based on dynamic markets allied to comparison and promotion of best practice.,108,1519
The key priorities are: to deliver more choice and lower prices through liberalisation of financial services and utilities; to promote business development with a common EU patent and cuts in red tape; to develop our common research effort in frontier technologies like bioscience; to cut delays and fares by establishing an integrated Air Traffic Control system for Europe; and to develop effective labour market policy to tackle unemployment in dialogue with the social partners.,108,1520
"We support efforts being made across the EU to reform welfare states, modernise social partnership and advance social inclusion.",108,1521
EU state aid policy should bear down on aids that distort the single market while supporting economic modernisation.,108,1522
"We will keep the veto on vital matters of national sovereignty, such as tax and border controls.",108,1523
Trade has been a vital source of prosperity for Europes citizens.,108,1524

Labour is pledged to do all it can to enable the first group of applicant countries to join in time to take part in the next European Parliamentary elections in 2004.,108,1530
It is vital we ratify the Treaty of Nice which is essential to enlargement; Labour in government will do so.,305,1531
The Conservatives have said they will insist on tr ying to renegotiate Europes treaties at the first summit after the election.,305,1532
No other country agrees with this.,305,1533
"That means that a Conservative government would either have to back down in the face of opposition, or take Britain out of Europe altogether with disastrous consequences for Britain.",305,1534
"Our argument is that if Britain is stronger in Europe, it will be stronger in the rest of the world.",107,1535
We reject the view of those who say we must choose between Europe and the USA.,305,1536
We shall remain the USAs firm ally and friend; but we are not going to turn our backs on Europe.,108,1537
"The USA and Europe account for ten per cent of world population but 60 per cent of global GDP; working together we can tackle many problems and spread the benefits of freedom, peace and prosperity.",108,1538
The main sources of popular legitimacy in Europe remain national governments and parliaments.,108,1540
"So national governments should be seen to be setting the agenda of the EU, with the European Council setting the EUs priorities, a strong independent Commission ensuring that the European interest is heard and enforced, and an effective European Parliament improving draft legislation and holding the Commission to account.",108,1541
"Labour wants the next Inter-governmental Conference in 2004 to address public concerns about the way the EU works, spelling out in a clear statement of principles what should and should not be done at European level.",108,1542
"Labour supports a stronger role for national parliaments in European affairs, for example in a second chamber of the European Parliament, with a particular remit to oversee the division of competences.",108,1543
We will also insist that the Commission completes its internal reform programme.,108,1544
Britains national security is based on the mutual support that comes from membership of NATO.,104,1546
That will not change.,104,1547
"And although Britain has rarely been more secure from foreign invasion, there are new threats to our people from crime and terrorism.",107,1548
"Instability around the world can affect us directly and we have a global responsibility to play our part in reducing international conflict, controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and contributing to international peace-keeping and peace-making operations.",107,1549
"To enable the European Union to act where NATO chooses not to, the EU should improve its military capabilities for humanitarian, peace-keeping and crisis management tasks.",106,1550

"Labour is committed to investing more in real terms in our armed services over the next three years, the first year-on-year real increase in funds for over a decade.",104,1552
An important part of that investment will be in better service accommodation.,104,1553
"We are determined to recruit and retain the best people, from all walks of life and all backgrounds.",104,1554
We will look after the interests of Britains veterans.,706,1555
"We have doubled funding for research on Gulf War illnesses, and will continue this important work.",104,1556
In 1997 Labour promised a strategic defence review.,305,1557
"Today, that review is admired around the world for its clarity, efficiency and foresight.",305,1558
"We need more mobile and more flexible armed forces, with the ability to project force at distance and speed, to work closely with other nations and international bodies, and to fight and keep the peace.",104,1559
"We have shown what this means in practice in Kosovo and Sierra Leone, and our servicemen and women have responded magnificently.",104,1560
We are determined to maximise resources for frontline use by disposing of surplus spares and promoting smart procurement and efficiency savings.,104,1561
The European Defence Initiative is an important part of our defence policy.,104,1562
"Europe spends two-thirds as much as the US on defence, but gets only a fraction of its effectiveness.",104,1563
European nations need to modernise their armed forces for rapid and flexible deployment.,104,1564
Improved EU military capabilities will not be separate from NATO structures and would only be deployed where NATO as a whole chooses not to engage.,104,1565
"The launch of an EU operation will follow a unanimous decision, with each member state free to decide whether to take part.",104,1566
"We support Trident, Britains minimum nuclear deterrent.",104,1567
The Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty commits us to work for the global elimination of nuclear weapons.,104,1568
"We are enthusiastic signatories to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, whose coming into force will impede nuclear proliferation, and we want to see the USA and Russia continue to reduce their nuclear stockpiles.",104,1569
"We recognise the new dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the need to combat them.",104,1570
Nuclear arms reductions and proliferation controls remain an important part of defence and security policy.,104,1571
We will seek effective inspections against the development of chemical and biological weapons.,104,1572
"We will encourage the US to consult closely with NATO allies on its ideas for missile defence, and to pursue dialogue with Russia on a new framework for strategic arms control that will encourage further cuts in nuclear weapons.",104,1573
"The British defence industry is a vital part of our economy, sustaining some 350,000 high-technology jobs.",104,1574
We will continue to work closely with our best companies to get the best equipment for our armed forces  a good deal for the taxpayer as well as a secure future for high-technology jobs.,104,1575
The UK has introduced the most open report on arms exports of any European nation and has led the EU to adopt a code of conduct on arms sales.,104,1576
"Labour will lead efforts to control the trade in small arms, and work for a comprehensive action plan at this years UN conference on small arms, including an international arms surrender fund to provide development aid in exchange for firearms.",107,1577
"We will legislate to modernise the regulation of arms exports, with a licensing system to control the activities of arms brokers and traffickers wherever they are located.",605,1578

"The World Trade Organisation must be reformed, not rejected.",107,1587
"We will support fairer terms of trade for developing countries, and a reduction in protectionism in the developed world in areas such as agriculture.",107,1588
We will continue to help developing countries exercise their rights within the WTO.,107,1589
"We support the promotion of higher labour standards around the world, as well as respect for the environment, as we expand world trade.",107,1590
"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is the place to set labour standards, but we believe there should be closer co-operation between the ILO and WTO through the creation of a joint standing forum of the two organisations.",107,1591
We are committed to encouraging universal observance of human rights.,107,1592
Governments that are democratically elected will be firmer allies for peace; open societies that respect individual freedom will be more reliable trade partners.,106,1593
Labour will be a friend of those denied human rights and a supporter of steps to strengthen them.,107,1594
"Labour has played a leading role in bringing war criminals, notably from former Yugoslavia, to justice, and in establishing a permanent court to try war crimes.",107,1595

"Britain is playing a leading world role on debt relief, education, HIV/AIDS, and in responding to humanitarian disasters.",305,1600
"With strong UK leadership, the international development effort is now increasingly focused on poverty reduction.",305,1601
"This is morally right, but also in our interest.",305,1602
There can be no secure future for any of us unless we promote greater global social justice.,107,1604
"Labour will continue to focus Britains development effort on the achievement of the international development targets by 2015  including halving the proportion of the worlds population living in extreme poverty, reducing child and infant mortality by two-thirds, primary education for all children, and sustainable development plans in every country.",107,1605
"With Labour the aid budget will rise to 0.33 per cent of GNP by 2003-04, reaching £3.6 billion  a 45 per cent increase in real terms since 1997 level.",107,1606
We remain committed to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of national income devoted to development and will make further substantial increases over the next Parliament.,107,1607
"We remain committed to our bill, blocked by the Tories, to consolidate our poverty-focused approach to development.",305,1608
We are using this aid to support political and economic reform in developing countries.,107,1609
"Our aid is an investment to help countries put in place policies to raise the growth rate with greater equity, crack down on corruption, promote human rights, including for women and girls, and develop effective governance and democracy.",107,1610
We will legislate to toughen controls over UK nationals who commit offences of corruption abroad.,107,1611

"Labour has led internationally on debt relief, providing 100 per cent relief for countries committed to spending the proceeds on poverty-reduction.",107,1615
We will work to help more of the heavily indebted poor countries qualify for debt relief where this benefits the poor.,107,1616
And we will work to prevent new debt burdens through international agreement not to give export credits for excessive military spending or prestige projects.,107,1617
Education has a special place for Labour.,107,1618
"We will increase further our support for quality primary education for all, particularly for girls.",107,1619
"Our Imfundo project, part of an £800 million education programme, will bring together public and private sector commitment to use IT to ensure effective teacher training and education management.",107,1620

"We will work for the creation of a global health fund to make essential drugs and commodities more accessible to the poor, focusing on TB, malaria and HIV/AIDS.",107,1622
"This will complement our existing support for the development of basic healthcare systems, and our new tax credits to incentivise research by the drug companies into the diseases of poverty.",107,1623
Development goes much wider than aid and debt relief.,107,1624
It is also about how we manage the global economy.,107,1625
Our aim is to shape globalisation so that it works better for the worlds poor.,107,1626
Trade is key but so is private investment.,107,1627
"We will promote socially responsible business practice through advisory services on codes of social responsibility, the ethical trading initiative, the Export Credit Guarantee Departments new code of business principles, the Commonwealth Development Corporations partnership with the private sector, and our initiatives to encourage private investment in infrastructure.",107,1628

"The poor make the smallest per capita contribution to climate change, but are often most affected when it happens.",501,1634
We are convinced by the scientific evidence of climate change  and convinced that now is the time to act.,501,1635
"We need action at local, national and international level if we are to preserve the stability of our natural environment over the next 50 years.",501,1636
The principle of mutual responsibility that governs our approach to social problems also applies to environmental issues.,501,1637
The healthy future of our environment is one of the worlds great challenges.,501,1638
We must make substantial changes in the way we work and live to safeguard all our futures.,501,1639

It is critical that the whole international community plays its part in making a reality of sustainable development.,501,1642

We are one of the few countries to have met our 1992 obligations to hold greenhouse gases in 2000 below their 1990 levels.,305,1644
In 1997 we set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2010.,305,1645
We will meet our obligations arising from the Kyoto protocol and have set out a detailed strategy to achieve more  a 23 per cent cut in greenhouse gases by 2010.,501,1646
"The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said the UK will need to cut CO2 production by 60 per cent by 2050, so we need to press ahead with a radical agenda for the development of low carbon economic growth, embodied in our £700 million commitment to renewable energy.",501,1647
 We must make the market work for the environment.,501,1649
Britain is developing the first national CO2 emissions trading system in the world.,501,1650
It will help companies find the most efficient way of reducing emissions  and reward them for doing so.,501,1651
Once the system is established here we will seek to extend it around the world.,501,1652
" We will support hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, which already offer a halving of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, with cheaper motoring to match  and for cleaner fuels and biofuels.",501,1653
By increasing demand for new technologies we can boost innovation and the vitality of the UK car industry.,501,1654
 It is imperative that we use natural resources more efficiently and recycle more.,501,1655
We will continue to tax pollution and reward clean production.,501,1656

"We will continue to make our contribution at home: leakage is down by almost 30 per cent since 1997, bills have been cut by 12 per cent and disconnections have been ended.",501,1660
 Environmental protection and sustainable development go hand in hand.,501,1661
"We cannot protect the environment without addressing the development needs of the poor, and poverty reduction depends on safeguarding natural resources on which poor people depend.",501,1662
" We will continue to provide leadership abroad, working for international agreement on climate change, improved integration of the environment in European policies and a strong global environment agency built around the current UN environment programme.",501,1663

Change to tackle crime and its causes.,605,1682
Change to deepen our democracy.,202,1683
Change to Britains role in the world.,107,1684
The Conservatives were rejected in 1997 because they had failed.,305,1685
The national debt had doubled; crime had doubled; we were 42nd in the world education league; one in five households was on benefit; and we were marginalised in Europe.,305,1686
"Yet instead of learning, the Conservatives have become more dogmatic, more extreme, more divided.",305,1687
They are worse than ever.,305,1688
"New Labour stands in the political mainstream, rooted in the best values of the British people.",305,1690
The Conservatives have veered to extreme positions.,305,1691
"This election will decide whether we continue the policies that have brought us economic stability, steady growth, investment in public services and targeted tax cuts for children and families, or whether we lurch back to boom and bust.",305,1692
"It will decide whether we put our schools, hospitals and police officers first, or put them second after unaffordable tax cuts.",305,1693
It will decide whether we modernise the criminal justice system.,305,1694
"It will decide whether we stand for a positive engagement with Europe and the wider world, or retreat to the sidelines.",305,1695
"But before you do, think of your job; think of your mortgage; think of your school and hospital; think of your children and your parents; think of police and crime prevention, think of the choice of leadership.",305,1697
There is still much to do with new Labour  and a lot for you to lose under the Conservatives.,305,1699
"The choice is clear: for an ambitious and confident Britain, the choice is Labour.",305,1700

"In the 1997 Labour manifesto Tony Blair said: We set out in the manifesto that follows ten commitments, commitments that form our bond of trust with the people.",305,1728
Judge us on them.,305,1729
Have trust in us and we will repay that trust.,305,1730

"This manifesto sets out that we will only lay a Budget before the House of Commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the OBR will independently verify.",414,16
We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next parliament.,414,17
This manifesto sets out that we will not compromise on this commitment.,414,18
Britain is a great country ready to build a better future.,601,22
This manifesto sets out Labours plan for national renewal.,601,23
"The British people, are known for tolerance, responsibility to others and for our belief in the value of hard work.",601,24
We look confidently outward to the world.,601,25
"These are great British traditions - things we all believe in, things our country is good at.",601,26
We are at our best when we work together.,601,27
"We see this every day in our workplaces, in our families, and in our communities.",601,28
"People want to get on, they want to give their children a better future, and they want to help to change Britain for the better.",601,29
But across Britain working people also know a simple truth: the economy is not working for them.,701,30
"For years now, our economy has not rewarded everyone who put in a good, honest days work.",701,31
"However hard people work, many dont earn enough to make ends meet.",701,32
"Too many have been driven from secure, full-time work, into precarious, badly paid jobs  many working on zero-hours contracts.",701,33
"Time to enjoy friends and family is increasingly squeezed, as mothers and fathers juggle the demands of work and caring for children, and often an older relative.",701,34
The problems mount for the next generation too.,706,35
Young people are taking on a mountain of debt to go to university and too many still cannot find a job worthy of their talents.,701,36
We lack a proper system of vocational education and apprenticeships to give our young people the start in life that they deserve.,411,37
We are not building the homes we need.,410,38
Our sons and daughters have been shut out of the housing market and too often they are forced to leave the communities where they were brought up.,503,39
Our economy and our system of government are failing people.,202,40
Many have come to believe that politics ignores the things that matter to them.,202,41
"Too much power is unaccountable, concentrated in the market and the state, at the expense of individuals and their communities.",202,42
Many of these problems have been mounting for years.,202,43
"Some, like the rise of inequality, are felt in countries all around the world.",503,44
"So the Conservatives did not cause all of them, but they have made them far worse.",305,45
Their view is that economic success depends just on a few at the top.,503,46
They think that insecurity will make people work harder and that low pay is the only way to be competitive in the global market.,503,47
They dont believe we can afford decent public services when times are hard.,409,48
"They have been giving power to large unaccountable firms rather than to people,",403,49
and now they want to make deeper cuts in the next three years than we have seen in the last five years.,409,50
There are some who believe there is nothing we can do to change things for the better.,409,51
They feel powerless.,409,52
They are losing faith that those with power will ever listen to them.,409,53
We understand these feelings.,409,54
But we believe we can renew our country and make a better future for working people.,503,55
We have learned the lessons of the past.,409,56
We were in government for thirteen years and left the country a far better place to live in.,409,57
But we did not get everything right.,305,58
We have learned and we have changed.,305,59
"Labour is renewing our traditions as the Party of work, family and community.",606,60
"We believe in a society of trust and mutual obligation,",606,61
"in which we look after the vulnerable, and people can bring up their families with hope for a better future.",503,62
"And we believe in helping people to help themselves, both to improve their own communities, and to achieve their ambitions.",503,63
We are also the Party of equality.,503,64
We believe that no person should suffer discrimination or a lack of opportunity.,503,65
The decisions we take in government will always be taken with this in mind.,503,66
The policies in our manifesto will help remove the barriers that stand in the way of greater equality.,503,67
We know we achieve more when we work together to challenge inequalities of power and build a common good.,503,68
"In this election, the country has a choice.",403,69
We can continue with a Conservative plan based on the view that success comes only from a privileged few at the top.,403,70
"Or we can change direction, begin to return power to people and build an economy together in which everyone can contribute to a shared and enduring prosperity.",403,71
We believe that Britain only succeeds when working families succeed.,701,72
"As the economy at last recovers, people want the opportunity to use their skills and talents to make a better life for themselves and their children.",701,73
Our countrys greatest asset is the hard work and talent of our people.,701,74
"Labours plan is to build firmer economic foundations for creating wealth, rewarding hard work and competing in the world.",403,75
"We will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on the current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament.",414,76
"This will need common sense spending reductions,",414,77
"outside of the protected areas of health,",504,78
education,506,79
and international development.,107,80
"We will ask those with incomes over £150,000 a year to contribute a little more through a 50p rate of tax.",414,81
"And we will build the high-skill, high-wage economy we need to raise tax revenues and control social security spending.",414,82
"We will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019,",412,83
banning exploitative zero-hours contracts,412,84
and promoting the Living Wage.,412,85
"We will create more paths to success for our young people by introducing a gold-standard system of technical education and training,",411,86
and the guarantee of an apprenticeship for every school leaver with the grades.,411,87
"We will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds,",504,88
while doubling paid paternity leave for fathers.,504,89
"We will help with household bills freezing energy prices until 2017, while reforming the broken energy market.",412,90
"And we will make sure that at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020,",408,91
and that private renters get a fairer deal.,403,92
The Bedroom Tax is cruel and we will abolish it.,504,93
"We will build up our NHS so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives,",504,94
"paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance.",504,95
"And we will bring together services for physical health, mental health and social care into a single system built around the individual.",504,96
We want a high quality education for all of our children.,506,97
"We will protect the education budget and raise teaching standards, making sure there are smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds.",506,98
The common life we share is who we are as a country.,601,99
"Not everyone is the same, but each of us sharing a sense of belonging, being valued equally and being able to contribute to the common good.",601,100
"Immigration has made an important contribution to our economic and social life,",601,101
but it needs to be properly controlled.,601,102
"With a Labour Government, migrants from the EU will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years.",110,103
"We will make it illegal to undercut wages by exploiting migrant workers,",701,104
and work to strengthen integration within our communities.,608,105
Everyone who works with the public in our public services must be able to speak English.,608,106
"We will help to make communities safer, by protecting and strengthening neighbourhood policing,",605,107
"countering extremism,",605,108
and putting in place tough new laws to reduce violence against women and,605,109
child sexual exploitation,605,110
People want more say in the decisions that affect their lives.,202,112
"We, in Labour, know that Government has to do things differently.",202,113
"The old command and control politics  doing things to and for people, but never with them  will not work.",202,114
We need a new approach to government that involves more people in decisions that affect them.,202,115
"So we will devolve more power and control, not only to Scotland and Wales, but to our great English cities and county regions too.",301,116
And we will share power and responsibility with people in their communities to help them help themselves and shape their services in response to their local circumstances.,301,117
"Our country faces global challenges of climate change,",501,118
terrorism,605,119
and the spread of disease.,605,120
"In particular, tackling climate change is an economic necessity and the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and future generations.",501,121
A Labour government will face up to these challenges and re-engage with the world.,501,122
"We will build alliances in Europe, promoting our countrys interests and security,",108,123
and standing up for human rights and social justice.,201,124
"We will work to reform the European Union, and we will retain our membership of it.",108,125
"Labours plan for national renewal will bring about real, meaningful change that each person will be able to feel in their daily life.",601,126
"We know that to make Britain a better country, opportunity must belong to everyone and not just a few.",503,127
"We will lend a helping hand to all those who need it, but we will also ask more of individuals and communities.",606,128
We can only rebuild our country if everyone plays their part and feels they have a stake in society.,606,129
We believe in living within our means.,414,130
"We will not make promises we cannot keep, and we will not introduce changes unless they are funded.",414,131
There is not a single policy in this manifesto that is funded by additional borrowing.,414,132
Not a single one.,414,133
"Our plan is to build a secure, prosperous and more equal country open to the world, in which everyone has the opportunity to get on and do their best.",601,134
We will provide strong and effective government but everyone will need to contribute and play their part.,601,135
"It will be hard, but working together we can do it.",601,136
We know a simple truth.,701,138
Britain only succeeds when working families succeed.,701,139
It is how our country has won through in the past and how it will succeed in the future.,701,140
But so many people are putting in the hours and not seeing the rewards.,701,141
That is why there is a cost of living crisis.,701,142
Our first task in government is to change our economy so that it works for all of Britains businesses and working people.,403,143
The Conservatives claim that the economy is fixed and that our country is on the right track.,403,144
"But the economy is not creating the productive, high-skilled and well-paid jobs that we need to raise living standards.",701,145
"The lack of rewarding work and training opportunities is trapping hundreds of thousands of young people in a cycle of benefits and low-paid, insecure jobs.",701,146
"And consumers are overcharged in markets they rely on to meet their everyday needs, whether to heat their homes or travel to work.",403,147
"For most of the 20th century, there was a vital link between the success of the country and family finances.",601,148
"As the country got better off, so did working people.",701,149
But the link between the success of the country and the family budget has been broken.,701,150
"Since 2010, working people are earning on average £1,600 less a year after inflation.",701,151
We have seen the greatest fall in wages over a parliament since 1874.,701,152
"Over five million people are in low-paid jobs, earning less than the Living Wage.",701,153
There are 1.8 million zero-hours contracts.,701,154
1.3 million are working part-time because they cannot get a full-time job.,701,155
Half of all those in poverty live in working households.,701,156
"900,000 people, many of them in work, used food banks last year.",701,157
"This cost-of-living crisis is bad for families, bad for business, and bad for Britain.",601,158
Lower levels of pay have meant lower tax receipts and higher spending on social security.,701,159
We will have to work and earn our way toward a more fairly shared and enduring prosperity.,701,160
We are a great commercial nation that has been at the centre of global trade for centuries.,401,161
We have a long tradition of innovation and enterprise.,411,162
We have been quick to seize the opportunities of the internet.,411,163
We have big strengths to build upon:,411,164
"world-leading universities,",411,165
"an outstanding science research base,",411,166
an open economy with one of the highest rates of foreign direct investment in the world,401,167
", and many successful global companies.",401,168
"An inclusive wealth-creating economy works when there is a shared sense of responsibility, so we will be a government that is both pro-business and pro-worker.",405,169
"We value all our businesses as organisations of innovation and wealth production, and we will work strategically with them to create wealth.",405,170
We value our trade unions as an essential force for a decent society and as guarantors of skills and fair wages.,405,171
The next Labour Government will balance the books.,414,173
"We will only lay a Budget before the House of Commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the Office for Budget Responsibility will independently verify.",414,174
We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next Parliament and these fiscal commitments will not be compromised.,414,175
We will tackle the root causes of the deficit by building a more productive economy with living standards that rise year-on-year.,414,176
The Conservative-led Government promised to balance the books in this Parliament.,414,177
But this promise has been broken.,414,178
The Conservatives will leave the country borrowing over £75 billion this year.,414,179
"Labours plan to balance the books means making tough, but fairer choices.",414,180
"We will reverse the Governments top-rate tax cut so that the highest one per cent of earners, with an income of over £150,000, contribute a little more to help get the deficit down.",414,181
"We will stop paying Winter Fuel Payments to the richest five per cent of pensioners, and cap child benefit rises for two years.",414,182
"Outside of the protected areas of health, education and international development there will be cuts in spending.",414,183
Ministerial pay will be cut and then frozen until we have balanced the books.,414,184
All proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS will be used to repay the national debt.,414,185
We will live within our means.,414,186
We have no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing.,414,187
All of our commitments will be paid for by reducing spending elsewhere or by raising extra revenue.,414,188
"For example, we will introduce a tax on properties worth over £2 million to help raise the £2.5 billion a year for an NHS Time to Care Fund ",414,189
part of our plan to save and improve the health service.,504,190
We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto commitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility at each general election.,414,191
We will cap structural social security expenditure in each spending review so that it is properly controlled.,414,192
"We will implement the proposals of Labours Zero-Based Review, which has already identified savings we will make through reforming old government bureaucracies,",303,193
"devolving power and services to our towns and cities,",301,194
"and redesigning public services, and which we will continue in government.",504,195
We will invest to prevent social problems rather than waste money reacting to them.,504,196
"And we will use digital technology to create a more responsive, devolved, and less costly system of government.",303,197
"We will create a fairer tax system, helping those on middle and lower incomes by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax, paid for by ending the Conservatives Marriage Tax Allowance.",503,199
We will not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax or National Insurance.,503,200
"Nor will we raise VAT, and we renew our pledge not to extend it to food, childrens clothes, books, newspapers or public transport fares.",503,201
Our first Finance Bill will close the tax loopholes that cost the Exchequer billions of pounds a year.,403,202
"We will introduce tougher penalties for those abusing the tax system, end unfair tax breaks used by hedge funds and others, and bear down on disguised employment.",403,203
"We will seek international agreement to make country-by-country reporting information publicly available, and we will act at home if agreement is not reached.",403,204
British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies will be required to produce publicly available registries of the real owners of companies based there.,403,205
We will carry out an immediate review into the culture and practices of HMRC so that everyone follows the same rules and we increase the rigour of the tax system.,303,206
And we will abolish non-dom status so that all those who make the UK their home pay tax in the same way as the rest of us.,403,207
It is by tackling tax avoidance in this concerted fashion that we can reduce the deficit and protect the family budgets of working people.,414,208
"Labour will improve productivity by building a long-term investment culture in the private and public sectors,",404,210
and supporting small businesses in their growth to becoming British success stories of the future.,403,211
"With Labour, Britain will continue to have the most competitive rate of Corporation Tax in the G7.",402,212
Building world-class infrastructure will be crucial to fostering economic growth.,411,213
We will create certainty for investors by taking a long-term approach to the major investment decisions facing the country.,404,214
We will set up an independent National Infrastructure Commission to assess how best to meet Britains infrastructure needs.,411,215
"It will make recommendations to government, monitor their implementation, and hold government to account.",411,216
These measures and our long-term approach will help reinforce Britains status as one of the worlds greatest centres of science and engineering.,411,217
"We will continue to support the construction of High Speed Two, but keep costs down,",411,218
and take action to improve and expand rail links across the North to boost its regional economies.,411,219
"We will support long-term investment in strategic roads, address the neglect of local roads, and promote cycling.",411,220
"Following the Davies Review, we will make a swift decision on expanding airport capacity in London and the South East,",411,221
balancing the need for growth and the environmental impact.,416,222
Scientific discovery and technological innovation will drive economic advancement this century.,411,223
"We will introduce a new long-term funding policy framework for science and innovation, providing the stability and continuity that our companies and research institutes need to succeed.",411,224
"We will work to make Britain a world leader in low carbon technologies over the next decade,",501,225
creating a million additional green jobs.,501,226
"This aim will be supported by ambitious domestic carbon reduction targets, including a legal target to remove the carbon from our electricity supply by 2030,",501,227
and a major drive for energy efficiency.,501,228
"Our industrial strategy for the green economy will end the current uncertainty for investors, with a timetable for the Green Investment Bank to be given additional powers so that it can invest in green businesses and technology.",501,229
"We will create an Energy Security Board to plan and deliver the energy mix we need, including renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal.",501,230
"For onshore unconventional oil and gas, we will establish a robust environmental and regulatory regime before extraction can take place.",501,231
"And to safeguard the future of the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a long-term strategy for the industry, including more certainty on tax rates",404,232
and making the most of the potential for carbon storage.,501,233
Labours longer-term approach will drive innovation and build on our strengths as a leader in digital technology.,411,234
We are just at the start of the internet revolution.,411,235
Digital technology has transformed start-up costs making it easier to run your own business.,411,236
"There is a widening in the application of new transformative technologies in the fields of robotics, genetics, 3D printing and Big Data.",411,237
Our economy is developing a network of connections that will revolutionise innovation.,411,238
"Labour will ensure that all parts of the country benefit from affordable, high speed broadband by the end of the Parliament.",411,239
"We will work with the industry and the regulator to maximise private sector investment and deliver the mobile infrastructure needed to extend coverage and reduce not spots, including in areas of market failure.",411,240
And we will support community-based campaigns to reduce the proportion of citizens unable to use the internet and help those who need it to get the skills to make the most of digital technology.,411,241
Our universities are amongst the finest in the world.,411,242
Some are already helping our regional economies by forming strong links with industry and creating high-tech clusters.,411,243
They have already spun out hundreds of companies creating thousands of jobs.,411,244
"We will support this model of knowledge clusters, especially outside the South East.",411,245
"Britains economy is being held back by the culture of short-termism, which is a major obstacle to the development of productive businesses and industries.",410,246
We will reform corporate governance to protect our leading firms from the pressure to put tomorrows share price before long-term growth potential.,403,247
Institutional investors will have a duty to act in the best interests of ordinary savers.,403,248
They will have to prioritise long-term growth over short-term profits for the companies in which they are investing.,403,249
We will change takeover rules to enhance the role of long-term investors by restricting voting to those already holding shares when a bid is made.,403,250
"In addition, we will strengthen the public interest test.",403,251
"We will improve the link between executive pay and performance by simplifying pay packages, and requiring investment and pension fund managers to disclose how they vote on top pay",403,252
And we will make sure employees have a voice when executive pay is set by requiring employee representation on remuneration committees.,403,253
"In this way we can start to create an economy based on mutual obligations, encouraging employers and employees to build partnerships for improving both business performance and job quality.",403,254
"Outdated practices, like blacklisting, have no place in a modern economy.",403,255
"Our charities, mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises are pioneering new models of production that enhance social value, promote financial inclusion, and give individuals and communities power and control.",403,256
We will continue to support and help develop the social economy by improving access for co-operative and mutual organisations to growth finance through the new British Investment Bank.,403,257
And we will consider how to support employee buy-outs when businesses are being sold.,403,258
"We will safeguard the public interest in the Royal Mail, supporting the creation of a staff-led trust for the employee share, and keeping the remaining 30 per cent in public ownership.",413,259
"We will also support the universal service obligation, ensuring competition does not undermine it and introducing protections as necessary.",403,260
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.,403,262
Their creativity and dynamism are vital for raising productivity and competing in the global economy.,403,263
"Labour will give them a voice at the heart of government  a Small Business Administration, which will ensure procurement contracts are accessible and regulations are designed with small firms in mind.",403,264
We will address rising costs for small businesses and strengthen rules on late payment.,403,265
Labour will put small businesses first in line for tax cuts.,402,266
"Instead of cutting Corporation Tax again for the largest firms, we will cut, and then freeze business rates for over 1.5 million smaller business properties.",402,267
We will develop a banking system that works for businesses in every region and every sector in Britain.,404,268
The long-standing problems of our banking system mean that too many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get the finance they need to invest and grow.,403,269
Labour will establish a British Investment Bank with the mission to help businesses grow and to create wealth and jobs.,402,270
"It will have the resources to improve access to finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and will support a network of regional banks.",402,271
We will increase competition on the high street.,403,272
Following the Competition and Market Authorities inquiry we want a market share test and at least two new challenger banks.,403,273
"And we will deal with the scourge of household debt by introducing a new levy on payday lenders, using the funds raised to boost low-cost alternatives like credit unions.",403,274
Britains route to prosperity and higher living standards is through more secure and better paid jobs,701,276
. But Conservative policies are causing whole sectors of the economy to be dragged into a race to the bottom on wages and skills.,701,277
The Government has weakened employment rights and promoted a hire-andfire culture.,701,278
"Labour believes our economy can only succeed in a race to the top  competing in the world with better work, better pay and better skills.",701,279
Too many people do a hard days work but remain dependent on benefits.,701,280
"We will raise the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019, bringing it closer to average earnings.",412,281
We will give local authorities a role in strengthening enforcement against those paying less than the legal amount.,301,282
"And we will support employers to pay more by using government procurement to promote the Living Wage, alongside wider social impact considerations.",701,283
Our Make Work Pay contracts will give tax rebates to businesses who sign up to paying the Living Wage in the first year of a Labour Government.,402,284
Publicly listed companies will be required to report on whether or not they pay the Living Wage.,701,285
It is hard for Britain to succeed when employees feel insecure and employers are undercut by those using exploitative working practices.,701,286
Labour will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts.,701,287
Those who work regular hours for more than 12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract.,701,288
We will abolish the loophole that allows firms to undercut permanent staff by using agency workers on lower pay.,701,289
"The Conservatives have introduced fees of up to £1,200 for employment tribunal claimants, creating a significant barrier to workplace justice.",701,290
"We will abolish the Governments employment tribunal fee system as part of wider reforms to make sure that affordability is not a barrier to workers having proper access to justice,",701,291
"employers get a quicker resolution,",701,292
and the costs to the tax payer do not rise.,701,293
"Labour is the Party of work, and we value working life.",701,294
We will push up standards and boost productivity by implementing the commitments in Labours Workplace and Business manifestos.,701,295
"Over 700,000 of our young people are unemployed",701,297
Too many of them do not have the skills they need for work.,701,298
And yet in the past year the number of young people starting apprenticeships has fallen.,701,299
"The Governments decision to triple university tuition fees leaves young people either starting their working lives burdened by £44,000 of debt, or without a clear alternative path to a decent career.",701,300
"Labour will cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year, funded by restricting tax relief on pension contributions for the highest earners and clamping down on tax avoidance.",506,301
We will tackle the growth of unpaid internships because thousands of highly able young people who cannot afford to work for free are locked out of too many of our professions.,701,302
"We will introduce a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee, paid for by a bank bonus tax.",701,303
"It will provide a paid starter job for every young person unemployed for over a year, a job which they will have to take or lose benefits.",701,304
For too long we have failed to provide a system which makes the best use of the talents of young people.,706,305
So we will guarantee every school leaver that gets the grades an apprenticeship.,411,306
"We will create thousands more apprenticeships in the public sector, including the civil service.",411,307
"Every firm getting a major government contract, and every large employer hiring skilled workers from outside the EU, will be required to offer apprenticeships.",411,308
We will give employers more control over apprenticeships funding and standards.,411,309
"In return, we will ask them to increase the number of high quality apprenticeships in their sectors and supply chains.",411,310
We will also give them the powers to deal with any free-riding employers who do not train.,403,311
Labours apprenticeships will be gold-standard qualifications.,411,312
"We will re-focus existing spending away from low-level apprenticeships for older people, and towards a system where apprenticeships are focused on new job entrants, lasting at least two years, and providing level three qualifications or above.",411,313
We will make sure that apprenticeships can lead to higher level qualifications by creating new Technical Degrees and supporting part-time study.,411,314
"They will be co-funded, co-designed and co-delivered by employers and they will be the priority for expansion within our university system.",411,315
"Young people who do not have the skills they need should be in training, not on benefits.",411,316
We will replace out of work benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds with a new Youth Allowance dependent on recipients being in training and targeted at those who need it most.,504,317
Labour will stand up for working families and businesses against vested interests.,403,319
We will reform the broken markets that people rely on most so that families and businesses get a fair deal.,403,320
Energy bills have risen by over £300 since 2010.,403,321
Many businesses say energy is the biggest cost they face.,403,322
"Lack of competition and transparency has allowed the large energy companies to get away with increasing bills when wholesale prices rise, but not cutting them when they fall.",403,323
The regulator has failed to take decisive action to protect consumers.,403,324
"Labour will freeze energy bills until 2017, ensuring that bills can fall but not rise, and we will give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter.",412,325
"During the freeze, we will reform the energy market so that it delivers fairer prices and a better deal for working families.",412,326
The generation and supply businesses of the Big Six energy companies will be separated.,403,327
"They will be required to open up their books, and they will have to sell their electricity through an open exchange.",403,328
We will simplify energy tariffs and make it easier for people to compare prices to get the best deal.,412,329
We will protect small businesses by ending unfair contracts and automatic rollovers to more expensive tariffs.,403,330
"A tough new energy watchdog will enforce our reforms, with powers to strip energy companies of their licences if they repeatedly harm the interests of consumers, and protect off-grid households.",403,331
"We will bring down energy bills by making homes more energy efficient, delivering a million interest free loans for energy home improvements in the next Parliament.",409,332
"For those on low incomes, we will make 200,000 homes warm every year, delivered street-by-street by local authorities and community organisations.",504,333
"Privately rented properties will have to meet a decency standard, bringing warmth to a further three million homes.",403,334
"The water industry, too, also requires reform.",403,335
One in five people struggle to pay their water bill.,403,336
"Despite this, only a fraction of customers have benefited from the social tariffs offered by water companies.",403,337
"Under our reforms all water companies will be required to sign up to a new national affordability scheme, helping those who cannot afford to pay their water bill.",403,338
"And we will strengthen the powers of the regulator to change licenses, limit price rises and enforce industry standards.",403,339
Living standards have been hit by fare increases on public transport.,403,340
"Since 2010, rail fares have risen by 20 per cent, leaving passengers paying the highest fares in Europe.",403,341
"Similarly, bus fares have risen by 27 per cent while at the same time 2,000 bus routes have been cut.",403,342
Labour will reform our transport system in order to provide more public control and put the public interest first.,403,343
We will review the franchising process as a priority to put in place a new system and avoid a repeat of the Conservatives franchising fiasco.,403,344
A new National Rail body will oversee and plan for the railways and give rail users a greater say in how trains operate.,403,345
We will legislate so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the private train operating companies on a level playing field.,403,346
Rail fares will be frozen next year to help commuters while we implement reforms.,412,347
"A strict fare rise cap will be introduced on every route for any future fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the cheapest ticket for their journey.",412,348
City and county regions will be given more power over the way buses are operated in their area.,301,349
"They will be able to decide routes, bear down on fares, drive improvements in services, and bring together trains, buses and trams into a single network with smart ticketing.",301,350
cut the deficit every year and balance the books as soon as possible in the  next Parliament,414,352
reverse the 50p tax cut so that the top one per cent pay a little more to help  get the deficit down,414,353
"not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax, National Insurance or  VAT",503,354
cut and then freeze business rates and maintain the most competitive corporate tax rates in the G7,402,355
abolish non dom status,403,356
increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October  2019,412,357
and introduce Make Work Pay contracts to provide tax rebates to firms  becoming Living Wage employers,402,358
ban exploitative zero-hours contracts,701,359
guarantee an apprenticeship for every school leaver who attains the  grades and require any firm that gets a large government contract to offer  apprenticeships,411,360
"reduce tuition fees to £6,000 a year",506,361
freeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter,412,362
introduce a British Investment Bank and support a network of regional banks.,414,363
"Our NHS, care services, schools, colleges and other public services make up the essential fabric of our society.",601,365
People need them to be able to live secure and fulfilling lives.,601,366
Britain needs them if we are to succeed as a country.,601,367
But under the Conservatives they are under threat.,601,368
"The next Labour Government will protect, improve and invest in our public services,",504,369
while giving individuals and communities more control over their design and delivery.,301,370
"The NHS is one of our great national institutions,",601,371
and it is one of Labours proudest achievements.,601,372
"It embodies our belief that by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone.",601,373
But the future of the NHS is under threat.,504,374
"The Conservatives have put the wrong values at its heart, and patients are finding it harder to get the care they need.",504,375
Care is at the heart of Labours values.,504,376
No-one should fear old age or be left to struggle alone caring for a loved one.,504,377
"But too many older people suffer insecurity, loneliness and exclusion.",504,378
And the growing social care crisis is one of the biggest challenges we face.,504,379
"Since 2010, billions of pounds have been cut from budgets that pay for adult social care.",504,380
"The result has been 300,000 fewer older people getting vital care services, at the same time as the number of older people in need of care is increasing.",504,381
A good education is vital to achieving personal fulfillment and economic prosperity.,506,382
A good society depends upon an education system that can open minds and teach the skills and knowledge we each need to get on in life.,506,383
But our education system is failing to meet the needs of young people who do not follow the traditional academic path from school to university.,506,384
Our public services are a measure of the strength and decency of our society.,601,385
But we need a change in how we design them by pushing power down and organising them around individuals and families not centralised bureaucracies.,301,386
Good public services also need committed staff who are treated fairly and whose ethos of service is respected.,701,387
"They require decisions on pay that prioritise those on lower incomes, which are evidence-based, and which respect Pay Review Body recommendations rather than brushing them aside irresponsibly.",701,388
"Government spends far too much money dealing with the symptoms of problems, instead of investing smaller amounts in dealing with their causes.",504,389
"Every taxpayer pays the cost of low educational achievement, poor aspirations, drink and drug misuse, and criminality.",504,390
"So we will promote early-years intervention, supporting young children and their parents and dealing with problems before they get out of hand.",504,391
We can save money and create more responsive services by building co-operation between public services and organisations.,504,392
Pooling funds across local areas reduces inefficiency and avoids duplication.,504,393
Services must be joined up in ways that make sense to the people who use them.,504,394
Labour will use digital technology in reforming our public services.,411,395
"People will be able to feed back on services quickly and simply, making sure their voices are heard, stimulating improvement and saving on the costs of service failure.",504,396
"Labour will rescue our NHS, invest in its future and join up services from home to hospital.",504,398
We will start with the promise of investment so that the NHS has time to care.,504,399
The NHS is struggling with staffing shortages.,504,400
"Accident and emergency is in crisis, and more people are facing long waits for tests, treatment, or to see a GP.",504,401
"Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance.",504,402
"The threshold for the Mansion Tax will rise in line with house prices for these high-value properties, and those on lower incomes will be protected with a right to defer the charge until the property changes hands.",504,403
"We will guarantee people a GP appointment within 48 hours, and on the same day for those who need it.",504,404
"We will create a Cancer Treatments Fund so patients have access to the latest drugs, surgery and radiotherapy.",504,405
"By 2020, patients will wait no longer than one week for vital cancer tests.",504,406
"Catching the disease early is critical, so we will raise public awareness of symptoms and make sure there is training and support for GPs in spotting early signs.",504,407
"The answer to the health challenges we face is not to set hospital against hospital, but to join up services around patients needs.",504,408
"We will repeal the Governments Health and Social Care Act, scrapping the competition regime and restoring proper democratic accountability for the NHS.",202,409
"We will establish a sensible commissioning framework, based on the principle of an NHS preferred provider, to stop the drive towards privatisation and make sure that NHS services are not destabilised by competition and fragmentation.",504,410
"Where private companies are involved in providing clinical services, we will impose a cap on any profits they can make from the NHS, to ensure that the needs of patients are always put first.",504,411
We support the principles behind the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Treaty (TTIP).,107,412
"We will hold the European Commission to account on issues of concern, including the impact on public services and the Investor to State Dispute Settlement Mechanism.",108,413
And we will ensure the NHS is protected from the TTIP treaty.,504,414
"Our health reforms will focus on prevention and early intervention, and joining up services from home to hospital.",504,415
"When people cannot get to see their GP, many go to A&E instead.",504,416
"When mental health problems are not spotted early, people can deteriorate and need more intensive support.",504,417
"And when elderly people cannot get the care they need at home, they are more likely to end up in hospital.",504,418
The current system is too fragmented.,504,419
It was not designed for the growing numbers of people living with chronic conditions or multiple needs.,504,420
"Rather than having three separate systems for dealing with physical, mental and social care, we will create a whole person approach: a single service to meet all of a persons health and care needs.",504,421
This will be underpinned by new rights for patients.,504,422
"Vulnerable older people, disabled people and those with complex needs will be helped to have more control of their lives with the entitlement to a personal care plan designed with them and shaped around their needs, the option of personal budgets where appropriate, and a single named person to coordinate their care.",503,423
They will also receive better information and advice on managing their condition.,503,424
These changes will help to end the frustration of families sick of being passed from pillar to post between different individuals and agencies.,503,425
"Commissioning and budgets will be brought together at a local level to join up services and make sure that providers are incentivised to help people stay healthy and outside hospital, rather than simply waiting for them to fall ill.",503,426
Mental health will be given the same priority as physical health.,504,427
People will have the same right to psychological therapies as they currently have to drugs and medical treatments.,504,428
"To help address the problem of undiagnosed mental illness, NHS staff training will include mental health.",504,429
"We will increase the proportion of the mental health budget that is spent on children, and make sure that teachers have training so they can identify problems early and link children up with support.",504,430
"To support young peoples health and wellbeing, we will encourage the development of social and emotional skills, for example through the use of mindfulness to build resilience.",504,431
"And we will set out a strategy with the goal of ensuring that the great majority of patients can access talking therapies within 28 days, and that all children who need it can access school-based counselling.",504,432
"A greater emphasis on prevention and public health is essential, not just to improve outcomes and tackle inequalities, but to ensure the NHS remains sustainable.",504,433
"For example, 3.2 million people are currently diagnosed with diabetes, and it is estimated that spending on treatment will rise from £10 billion to £17 billion a year over the next 25 years if action is not taken, such as to reduce levels of obesity.",504,434
"We will set a new national ambition to improve the uptake of physical activity and take targeted action on those high strength, low cost alcohol products that fuel problem drinking.",504,435
"And we will set maximum permitted levels of sugar, salt and fat in foods marketed substantially to children.",504,436
"Everyone involved in the NHS must learn lessons when things go wrong, for example, from the failings at Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay.",504,437
Labour will prioritise action to improve care quality and patient safety.,504,438
"In addition to recruiting extra nurses to help provide safe levels of staffing on wards, we want every hospital death to be subject to an appropriate level of review.",504,439
We will also take action to modernise the regulation of healthcare professionals.,504,440
Labour will support people in their older age.,504,442
Growing old should be a positive and fulfilling experience.,504,443
"But our social care system is close to collapse, with older people often receiving visits limited to just 15 minutes, provided by a workforce that is too often undervalued.",504,444
Labour supports measures to cap the costs of care and will prioritise improving the quality of care services.,504,445
"Working with local authorities and care providers, Labour will end time-limited 15-minute visits, introducing year-of-care budgets to incentivise better care in the home.",504,446
"By stopping the use of zero-hours contracts, where regular hours are being worked, we will improve the working life of care workers.",701,447
"For older people, the normal setting for care should increasingly be the home, not the hospital.",504,448
"We will recruit 5,000 new home-care workers  a new arm of the NHS  to help care for those with the greatest needs at home.",504,449
"This will include supporting more people to remain at home at the end of their life, including those who are terminally ill with the greatest care needs.",504,450
"We will also introduce a system of safety checks to identify risks facing vulnerable older people and enable preventative measures to be put in place, such as grab rails to prevent falling.",504,451
"The burden of the care crisis is falling on carers, especially women, who account for six in every ten carers.",504,452
Labour will introduce a new duty on NHS organisations to identify carers so that they can be linked up with the right support.,504,453
We will ring-fence the money councils get for carers breaks to ensure this money gets spent on carers.,504,454
Labour sees investment in education as an investment both in our children and in the future of the country.,506,456
"We will protect the entire education budget, including the early years, schools and post-16 education, so that it rises in line with inflation.",506,457
However investment on its own is not enough.,506,458
We need to create a route to success for the 50 per cent of young people who do not go down the traditional academic route.,411,459
"We will raise the standard and status of vocational and technical education, with a high quality vocational route from school through to employment.",411,460
"The Technical Baccalaureate, a vocational award for 16 to 18-year-olds, will combine a gold-standard qualification accredited by employers, with a quality work placement.",411,461
"We will transform high performing Further Education colleges with strong links to industry, into new specialist Institutes of Technical Education, with a remit to deliver the Technical Baccalaureate and higher-level skills.",411,462
We will support more young people to gain the core skills they need for employment and further study.,411,463
"With Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18 and undertake work experience between the ages of 14 and 16.",506,464
"And to ensure young people are equipped to make the best choices for their future, we will introduce a new, independent system of careers advice, offering personalised face-to-face guidance on routes into university and apprenticeships.",506,465
We believe fundamentally that a world-class education system is made by excellent teachers.,506,466
"With Labour, every teacher will need to gain qualified teacher status.",506,467
We will encourage teaching quality by creating new career routes for teachers who are expert in their subject.,506,468
These teachers will be able to attain a new Master Teacher status.,506,469
"Teachers will also be expected to update their knowledge and skills as a condition of remaining in the profession, and we will support plans for a new College of Teaching.",506,470
"These measures will help us close the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers, and work towards all children reading well by age 11.",506,471
We have supported the successful Teach First since its inception and will continue to do so.,506,472
A new School Leadership Institute will support headteachers and improve school leadership.,506,473
"It will accredit gold-standard headship qualifications, support leadership training and development, and identify and develop the school leaders of the future.",506,474
The Government has attempted to oversee thousands of schools from the centre.,506,475
This approach is not working.,506,476
Underperformance is going unchallenged and parents do not have enough of a voice.,506,477
"Labour will introduce new Directors of School Standards at a local level to monitor performance, intervene in underperforming schools and support them to improve.",506,478
"Where a majority of local parents have concerns about underperformance, or a dip in standards, they will be able to call in their local Director of School Standards to hold a school to account.",506,479
Labour will promote innovation in schools.,506,480
We will give all schools freedoms currently only granted to some.,506,481
"Directors of School Standards will be responsible for commissioning new schools where there is a shortage of school places, encouraging innovative bids from established providers, good local authorities, parents, teachers and entrepreneurs.",506,482
They will also encourage local schools to work together to improve the quality of education.,506,483
"We will end the wasteful and poorly performing Free Schools programme, and switch resources to where they are needed, allowing us to cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds at 30 pupils or under.",506,484
"Private schools currently benefit from generous state subsidies, including business rates relief worth hundreds of millions of pounds.",506,485
We believe they should do more to contribute to raising standards in state education to justify receiving this subsidy.,506,486
"As a condition for continued business rate relief, private schools will be required to form a meaningful partnership with a school, or cluster of schools, in the state sector.",506,487
Children develop and learn best when they are secure and happy.,506,488
"We need to help our children develop the creativity, self-awareness and emotional skills they need to get on in life.",506,489
We will introduce compulsory age-appropriate sex and relationships education,506,490
". We will encourage all schools to embed character education across the curriculum, working with schools to stop the blight of homophobic bullying.",506,491
"invest £2.5 billion more that the Conservatives to recruit 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives",504,493
guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours and cancer tests within one week,504,494
"join up services from home to hospital, with a single point of contact for all who need it",504,495
"give mental health the same priority as physical health, with a new right to access talking therapies",504,496
"repeal the Governments privatisation plans, cap profits and put the right values back at the heart of the NHS",504,497
"end time-limited 15 minute social care visits and recruit 5,000 new  home-care workers to support people in their home",504,498
introduce a new gold-standard Technical Baccalaureate for 16 to-18-year olds,411,499
protect the entire education budget from early years through to post-16 education,506,500
guarantee all teachers in state schools will be qualified,506,501
appoint Directors of School Standards to drive up standards in every area,506,502
"cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds",506,503
ensure all young people study English and Maths to age 18.,506,504
"As a country we value compassion, tolerance and a sense of decency.",601,506
"But pressures on family life, growing inequality, anxieties about crime and anti-social behaviour, and a widespread loss of trust in our governing institutions, are creating insecurity in many communities.",606,507
"Labour believes a decent society grows out of family life and relationships, out of the work we do, and the local places to which we belong.",606,508
"We will help to create a more secure and inclusive society by building and strengthening the institutions that help individuals, families and communities to thrive.",606,509
"Peoples relationships bind society together, and the family, in all its various shapes and sizes, is its bedrock.",604,511
"But low pay, the pressures of work and caring for children and elderly relatives, have put families under increasing pressure.",503,512
"We will help families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours per week for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for with an increase in the bank levy.",504,513
We will also introduce a legal guarantee for parents of primary school children to access wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm through their local primary school.,504,514
"As well as helping parents, this will provide children with before and after-school clubs and activities, helping to raise their aspirations and attainment.",504,515
"This will be underpinned by a new National Primary Childcare Service, a not for profit organisation to promote the voluntary and charitable delivery of quality extracurricular activities.",504,516
"Labour recognises the vital importance of the power of peoples relationships to build the capacity for love, care and resilience.",606,517
"We will prioritise early years intervention to give children and parents the best start in family life, and restore the role of Sure Start centres as family hubs.",504,518
"Sure Start will have an obligation to provide families with access to childcare, opening their facilities to charities and local childcare providers.",504,519
"More widely, we will encourage local services to co-locate, so that they work together to shift from sticking plaster solutions to integrated early help.",504,520
"We will take a whole-family approach to policy making, supporting relationships, and the involvement of fathers, grandparents and relatives in the care, education and health of children.",504,521
More fathers want to play an active role in their childrens lives and families want to spend more time together with a new baby.,504,522
"So we will double the current two weeks of paternity leave to four weeks, and increase the amount of paternity pay from £140 to more than £260 a week.",504,523
"Many grandparents want to be more involved in caring for their grandchildren, and we will support them in doing so.",504,524
"As a result of this Governments failures, the commitment to ending child poverty by 2020 is very unlikely to be met.",504,525
"However, we will never forget how important a decent basic income is to a childs prospects and wellbeing.",504,526
"That is why we will keep the child poverty targets, and ask the Office for Budget Responsibility to monitor and report on progress.",504,527
We will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable children,504,528
and we will introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse.,504,529
"We will increase support for children in kinship (family and friends) care and their families, a group too often overlooked and undervalued.",504,530
"We will continue to support Frontline and its innovative approach to training social workers, and teachers will receive better training for working with children with special educational needs and disabilities.",504,531
"Britain is in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, with the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.",410,533
Young people have been priced out of home ownership.,410,534
"Fewer affordable homes are being built, homelessness is rising, and millions face insecurity and poor standards in the private rented sector.",410,535
"Everyone should be able to live in a secure home, whether they rent or buy.",503,536
"We will make sure that at least 200,000 homes a year get built by 2020  almost double the current level  by implementing the recommendations of the Lyons Review.",410,537
It is only by building more homes that peoples aspiration for home ownership will be fulfilled.,410,538
"Our comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis will give local communities new powers to provide the homes they need, in the places they want to live.",301,539
"To help young people and families get on the housing ladder, we will give local authorities the power to give first call to first time buyers on new homes in areas of housing growth.",410,540
And we will unlock a Future Homes Fund by requiring that the billions of pounds saved in Help to Buy ISAs be invested in increasing housing supply.,410,541
We want a housing market that rewards the building of high quality homes rather than land banking and speculation.,410,542
So we will introduce greater transparency in the land market and give local authorities new use it or lose it powers to encourage developers to build.,301,543
"We will increase competition in the housebuilding industry by backing small builders, including through our Help to Build scheme,",403,544
and by getting the public sector building again.,504,545
We will build more affordable homes by prioritising capital investment for housing and by reforming the council house financing system.,403,546
"We will give local authorities powers to reduce the number of empty homes, including higher council tax on long term empty properties.",403,547
"And to boost the housing we need, we will start to build a new generation of garden cities.",410,548
"For the 11 million people who rent privately, we will legislate to make three-year tenancies the norm, with a ceiling on excessive rent rises.",403,549
A ban on unfair letting agent fees will save renters over £600.,403,550
We will drive standards up by creating a national register of private landlords.,403,551
Homelessness is the ultimate symbol of the housing crisis.,503,552
"Labour reduced homelessness by 70 per cent when we were last in office, but all forms of homelessness are back on the rise, with rough sleeping having increased by 55 per cent.",503,553
We are committed to reversing this trend by tackling the causes of homelessness and rough sleeping.,503,554
Britain needs a responsible and fair social security system that provides security when people lose their jobs,504,556
"or fall sick,",504,557
as well as a decent income when they retire.,504,558
"The British people have always believed in the principle of contribution, rewarding those who pay in, helping people get back on their feet, and providing support in times of need.",606,559
"To guarantee a decent social security system for the next generation, we need to keep costs under control.",505,560
"Under this Government, the increase in low pay has left working families more reliant on tax credits and housing benefit, pushing up the social security bill.",701,561
"To get the benefits bill under control, we need to tackle the root causes of rising spending, by making work pay and building more homes.",403,562
"We will allow local authorities that negotiate rent reductions on behalf of tenants who are claiming housing benefit, to retain some of the savings, on the condition that the money is invested in building homes.",403,563
We will keep the household benefit cap and ask the Social Security Advisory Committee to examine if it should be lower in some areas.,505,564
"And we will cap structural social security spending as part of each spending review, so that it is properly planned and controlled.",505,565
Labour believes in rewarding work and in restoring contribution to the heart of our system.,701,566
So we will not cut tax credits.,504,567
"We want everyone who can to have the chance to contribute through paid work, so we will create a more tailored back-to-work system that helps people secure and keep jobs.",701,568
"We will do more to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work, testing jobseekers Maths, English and IT skills within six weeks of them claiming benefits.",701,569
They will be required to take up training where this will improve their chances of getting a job.,701,570
"We support the principle behind Universal Credit  that there should be a smooth transition into work  but it must be affordable and fit for purpose, so we will pause and review the programme.",701,571
"There will be a guaranteed, paid job for all young people who have been out of work for one year,",701,572
and for all those over 25 years old and out of work for two years.,701,573
"It will be a job that they have to take, or lose their benefits.",701,574
"And we will commission a replacement for the Work Programme at a more local level, working with local authorities to join up support for the long-term unemployed.",701,575
We will introduce a higher rate of Job Seekers Allowance for those who have contributed over years.,504,576
It will be funded by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify.,505,577
"Alongside strong and responsive public services, the social security system plays an important role in supporting many disabled people to live independently, and must always treat sick and disabled people with dignity.",504,579
"Half a million families have been hit by the Bedroom Tax, and two thirds of those affected are disabled, or have a disabled family member.",504,580
"It is cruel, and we will abolish it.",504,581
We will reform the Work Capability Assessment and focus it on the support disabled people need to get into work.,504,582
We will give an independent scrutiny group of disabled people a central role in monitoring it.,504,583
And we will introduce a specialist support programme to ensure that disabled people who can work get more tailored help.,504,584
"Older people deserve to live a fulfilling life, to continue working if they wish, and to enjoy a secure retirement.",504,586
Older people have contributed all their lives and built the Britain that the next generation  will inherit.,606,587
"So it is right that they are supported with a fair and sustainable pensions system, responsive health services and a system of care over which they have control.",504,588
"We will keep the triple-lock so that the state pension increases by inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest.",504,589
"And while increases in the state retirement age are necessary to keep our pensions system affordable, we will ensure that people have time to plan for changes.",504,590
"We have taken the tough choice to restrict Winter Fuel Payments for the richest five per cent of pensioners,",505,591
"but we will guarantee that there will be no additional changes to the Winter Fuel Payments, free TV licences or bus passes for pensioners.",504,592
"Alongside a decent state pension, we must ensure private pensions are good value for those who have saved.",403,593
"We will reform the pensions market so that pension providers put savers first, and protect consumers from retirement rip-offs.",403,594
"We support greater flexibility for those drawing down their pension pots, but there must be proper guidance for people to avoid mis-selling.",403,595
"For our country to stay strong, with the confidence to look outwards rather than inwards, people need to feel secure in the strength of our borders,",601,597
"our communities,",606,598
and in the workplace.,701,599
"Britain has seen historically high levels of immigration in recent years, including low-skilled migration, which has given rise to public anxiety about its effects on wages, on our public services, and on our shared way of life.",403,600
"Despite the Conservatives promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, it is now higher than it was when David Cameron entered Downing Street.",403,601
Broken promises erode trust.,403,602
Labour will never cut Britain off from the rest of the world.,601,603
"Our economy and our society benefit from the talent and investment of people who come here, including university students coming to study.",607,604
But the system needs to be controlled and managed so that it is fair.,403,605
Low-skilled migration has been too high and needs to come down.,403,606
We need much stronger action to stop illegal immigration.,605,607
Labours plan starts with stronger borders,605,608
"We will recruit an additional 1,000 borders staff, paid for by a small charge on non-visa visitors to the UK.",605,609
"We will introduce stronger controls to prevent those who have committed serious crimes coming to Britain,",605,610
and to deport those who commit crimes while they are here.,605,611
"We will introduce full exit checks, so that we can count people in and out of the country.",605,612
"Short-term student visitor visas have dramatically increased, so we will tighten the system to prevent abuse,",605,613
whilst welcoming overseas university students who bring billions into Britain.,605,614
And we will keep the cap on workers from outside the EU.,406,615
"We need fair rules at work to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers, which undercuts local wages and increases demand for further low-skilled migration.",701,616
Labour will introduce a new law to stop employers undercutting wages by exploiting workers.,701,617
We will ban recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas,605,618
and crack down on rogue agencies by extending the remit of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority where there is evidence of abuse.,605,619
We need to strengthen our social integration and ensure that migrants can play their part in British society.,608,620
"People working in public services, in public facing roles, will be required to speak English.",608,621
"Those who come here will not be able to claim benefits for at least two years, and we will stop child benefit being sent to families living abroad.",608,622
We will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively.,605,623
"We will end the indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system,",201,624
ending detention for pregnant women,201,625
and those who have been the victims of sexual abuse or trafficking,201,626
"And we will ensure Britain continues its proud history of providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international obligations,",107,627
including working with the UN to support vulnerable refugees from Syria.,107,628
Crime creates fear and insecurity.,605,630
"We can only live happy and fulfilled lives if we know that we are safe, and that we are not at risk of violation of our person or property.",605,631
For too many people in our country that is not the reality they see in their communities.,605,632
"Neighbourhood policing, the vital building block of British policing, is at risk of being destroyed.",605,633
"Anti-social behaviour is too often tolerated, rather than dealt with.",605,634
"Violent crimes have gone up, but fewer violent criminals are being caught.",605,635
Far too many victims of child sex abuse are being let down by the services that are supposed to keep them safe.,605,636
"Labour believes British policing is at its best when it is rooted in local communities, proactively preventing crime, rather than simply reacting to emergencies.",605,637
We will protect neighbourhood policing.,605,638
"By making different choices  to abolish Police and Crime Commissioners,",605,639
"end the subsidy of firearms licenses,",605,640
and mandate police forces to work closer together,605,641
" we will be able to safeguard over 10,000 police officers for the next three years.",605,642
"This will be backed up by a new statutory Local Policing Commitment, guaranteeing neighbourhood policing in every community.",605,643
We will strengthen community safety partnerships to give local people a role in setting priorities for neighbourhood policing and a say over the appointment of local police commanders.,605,644
"To raise standards within policing, all police officers will be required to become Chartered Officers, holding a registration with the College of Policing, and able to be struck off for serious misconduct, just as doctors and lawyers can be.",605,645
A new Police Standards Authority will replace the discredited Independent Police Complaints Commission.,605,646
And we will work with the police to improve ethnic minority recruitment so that the police better reflect the communities they serve.,605,647
The next part of Labours plan is preventing crime occurring in the first place.,605,648
"We will nip anti-social behaviour in the bud by making offenders put right the wrong they have done, with payback orders replacing low-level cautions.",605,649
"And we will ensure staff who work with the public are given greater protection, with tougher penalties for those who assault them.",605,650
"The last Labour Governments reforms of youth justice, which required agencies to collaborate in preventing youth offending, reduced both youth crime and the numbers of young people in prison.",605,651
"The next Labour Government will extend this model, piloting a new approach to 18 to 20-year-old offenders, incentivising local authorities, police and probation services to work together to identify those at risk of drifting into criminal activity and, where possible, divert them into a more constructive way of life.",605,652
And we will work to embed restorative justice right across the youth justice system.,605,653
We know drug addiction continues to be a major cause of crime.,605,654
"We will ensure drug treatment services focus on the root causes of addiction,",504,655
"with proper integration between health, police and local authorities in the commissioning of treatment.",504,656
"And we will ban the sale and distribution of dangerous psychoactive substances, so called legal highs.",605,657
It is clear that we need a radical change in our approach to dealing with child abuse.,605,658
"We will bring in tough new powers enabling the police to prevent an adult from contacting or communicating with a child if there is evidence of abuse,",605,659
and strengthen the vetting and barring regime.,605,660
"A new child protection unit will be established to work across government, driving progress in the prevention of child abuse and sexual exploitation.",605,661
We need prisons that both punish and rehabilitate people.,605,662
Labour will do more to increase the amount of time prisoners spend working and learning.,605,663
Prisons will be measured by how successful they are in reforming prisoners and reducing their re-offending.,605,664
"We will also raise professional standards amongst prison officers, including through the creation of Chartered Prison Officers,",605,665
and confront the neglected problem of staff corruption.,605,666
We will enact Britains first Victims Law to give victims of crime a voice and an entitlement to minimum standards of service from criminal justice agencies.,605,667
Two women a week are killed by a current or former male partner.,605,669
"At least 750,000 children a year witness domestic violence.",605,670
Stopping violence against women and girls is a priority for Labour.,605,671
"We will publish a Violence against Women and Girls Bill,",605,672
"appoint a commissioner to set minimum standards in tackling domestic and sexual violence,",605,673
and provide more stable central funding for womens refuges and Rape Crisis Centres.,605,674
"We will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a response to domestic violence.",605,675
"The gun licensing regime will be tightened, so that people with a history of domestic or sexual violence will not be given an unrestricted license.",605,676
"And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape suspects have their DNA recorded and stored.",605,677
Victims of domestic violence need far better support.,605,678
So we will widen access to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.,605,679
The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing.,605,681
"Hundreds of British citizens have joined Islamic State  a movement that has engaged in savage violence, and racial and religious hatred.",605,682
"The British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so again, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.",601,683
"With Labour, the security services will have the powers they need to disrupt and tackle terrorism.",605,684
The Government were wrong to weaken counter terror powers by scrapping Control Orders.,605,685
"With Labour, dangerous suspects will be subject to proper controls.",605,686
Every government department will be engaged in the work of preventing extremism and fighting terrorism.,605,687
We will implement a much more rigorous strategy for dealing with people returning from the Syrian conflict.,605,688
"Alongside appropriate police action and prosecution, it will be mandatory for anyone returning to engage in a de-radicalisation programme designed to confront them with the consequences of their actions.",605,689
"We will need to update our investigative laws to keep up with changing technology, strengthening both the powers available, and the safeguards that protect peoples privacy.",605,690
"This is why Labour argued for an independent review, currently being undertaken by David Anderson.",605,691
We will strengthen the oversight of our intelligence agencies to make sure the public can continue to have confidence in the vital work that they do to keep us safe.,605,692
"To defeat the threats of Islamist terrorism, we must also engage with the personal, cultural and wider factors that turn young people to extremism.",606,693
The Prevent programme was set up under the last Labour Government to stop young people becoming radicalised.,606,694
But this Government has cut the funding and narrowed its focus.,606,695
Much of the work to engage Muslim communities has been lost.,606,696
"We will overhaul the programme to involve communities in countering extremist propaganda,",606,697
"stopping young people being groomed,",606,698
and also building resilient institutions for social integration.,608,699
We applaud those faith communities who have pioneered an inter-faith dialogue for the common good.,601,700
"We will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime, such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.",605,701
"We will challenge prejudice before it grows, whether in schools, universities or on social media.",503,702
"And we will strengthen the law on disability, homophobic, and transphobic hate crime.",605,703
Labour believes that art and culture gives form to our hopes and aspirations and defines our heritage as a nation.,502,705
The arts allow us to celebrate our common humanity in the creation and celebration of beauty. The arts should belong to all and be open to all to take part in.,502,706
We will guarantee a universal entitlement to a creative education so that every young person has access to cultural activity and the arts by strengthening creative education in schools and after-school clubs.,502,707
"Institutions that receive arts funding will be required to open up their doors to young people,",502,708
and we will work with public bodies to rebalance arts funding across the country.,502,709
"The last Labour Government made admission to our national museums and galleries free to all, leading to a major increase in the number of people experiencing our greatest cultural treasures.",502,710
We reaffirm our commitment to universal free admission to ensure that our great works of art and national heritage can be enjoyed in all parts of the country.,502,711
Creativity is the powerhouse of a prosperous economy.,502,712
It is the source of economic innovation and a powerful force in social renewal.,502,713
We will increase the number of apprenticeships in the creative industries.,502,714
"We will create a Prime Ministers Committee on the Arts, Culture and Creative Industries, with a membership drawn from all sectors and regions.",502,715
The Committee will bring issues of concern direct to the attention of the Prime Minister.,502,716
Sport brings us together in an expression of our local and national pride.,601,718
"It is where young people learn about leadership, teamwork, the pursuit of excellence and strength of character.",606,719
With a Labour Government our children will participate in a minimum of two hours of organised sport every week at school.,502,720
Football clubs are an important part of many peoples identity and sense of belonging.,502,721
They are more than just businesses.,502,722
"But despite their importance in the lives of their members and supporters, too often there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run.",202,723
Labour will provide the means for supporters to be a genuine part of their clubs.,202,724
We will introduce legislation to enable accredited supporters trusts to appoint and remove at least two of the directors of a football club and to purchase shares when the club changes hands.,202,725
We will also review the role of fan participation in other sports.,202,726
We will ensure the Premier League delivers on its promise to invest five per cent of its domestic and international television rights income into funding the grassroots.,502,727
"We feel passionately about our local landscapes, our open spaces and wildlife.",501,729
"Land and nature are part of our common home and inheritance, and they contribute to our sense of identity.",501,730
"In a globalised world, our local environment provides us with a sense of place and belonging.",501,731
"As we set out in more detail later on, a Labour Government will play a leading global role in tackling climate change.",501,732
"However, it will not be enough to simply mitigate the threat of climate change.",501,733
"We must adapt to its damaging effects, which are impacting on us today.",501,734
"We will produce an ambitious adaptation programme,",501,735
and the new Infrastructure Commission will prioritise investment in flood prevention.,501,736
"We will deal with the problems of air pollution by giving local authorities the powers they need, backed up by a national framework.",501,737
"Labour has always believed that everyone should have access to nature, whoever they are, or wherever they live.",501,738
So we will keep our forests in public ownership,413,739
and promote access to green spaces in local planning.,501,740
"We will support the work of the Natural Capital Committee to protect and improve wildlife habitats and green spaces, and make them an important part of our thriving tourism industry.",501,741
We will build on our strong record on animal welfare  starting with an end to the Governments ineffective and cruel badger cull.,501,742
"We will improve the protection of dogs and cats,",501,743
"ban wild animals in circuses,",501,744
defend the hunting ban,501,745
and deal with wildlife crime associated with shooting.,501,746
"We want to create a world-leading Food, Farm and Fisheries sector that creates better paid jobs and apprenticeships across the rural economy.",703,747
"We will put in place a long-term strategy for the sector,",703,748
"promote the best of British produce,",703,749
"and expand the role of the supermarket watchdog to support the growth of the sector,",703,750
and protect food producers from unfair practices by the major supermarkets.,703,751
"extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds,",504,753
and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm,504,754
double paternity leave from two to four weeks,504,755
and increase paternity pay by more than £100 a week,504,756
"ensure at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020,",410,757
with first priority for local first time buyers,706,758
provide security for renters by guaranteeing three-year tenancies,403,759
with a ceiling on excessive rent rises,403,760
"introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a Bank Bonus Tax",403,761
abolish the Bedroom Tax,504,762
ensure migrants will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years,505,763
make it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers,403,764
"protect neighbourhood policing by safeguarding over 10,000 frontline police officers over the next three years",605,765
give football fans a voice in club boardrooms.,202,766
People who live in this country know that too much power is concentrated in too few hands.,202,768
"Those who make decisions on behalf of others, whether they are in Westminster, the European Union, in business, the media, or the public sector, are too often unaccountable.",202,769
"Our over-centralised system of government has prevented our nations, cities, county regions and towns from being able to take control and change things for themselves.",301,770
We will end a century of centralisation.,301,771
Labour believes meaningful and lasting change for the better is only possible when people are given the power to change things for themselves.,301,772
"Our governing mission is to break out of the traditional top-down, 'Westminster knows best approach', and devolve power and decision-making to people and their local communities.",301,773
From the City of London to Silicon Valley the worlds best industries tend to be clustered geographically.,301,774
"And too often economic challenges can be too, from our coalfields to some of our isolated seaside towns.",301,775
So a Labour government will unleash the potential of our city and county regions to drive economic growth and prosperity.,301,776
"We will reform institutions and devolve power to deal with the causes of our economic problems,",301,777
and we will encourage local authorities to innovate to better serve their communities.,301,778
"Instead of imposing change on communities, we will give them more control over schools, health care, policing, skills, housing and transport, making use of their insights into what works and what does not.",301,779
We will promote and encourage a model of citizenship based on participation and shared responsibility.,606,780
These measures are the start of big changes in how we govern ourselves as a union of nations.,301,781
They will begin to transform the relationship between the citizen and the state.,301,782
"We will further develop digital government to enable better communication, more collaboration, and sharing of data between services.",303,783
It will make services and transactions more efficient and simpler for people to use.,303,784
"To create a more connected society we will support making digital government more inclusive, transparent and accountable.",303,785
"We will continue to back the principle of open data by default, releasing public sector performance data wherever possible.",303,786
"We will give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote by May 2016,",202,788
"and improve the curriculum for citizenship education, so young people have the knowledge they need to play a full part in British society.",202,789
"We will encourage young peoples volunteering and social action by supporting the #iwill campaign of Step up to Serve, and the National Citizens Service.",606,790
"Drawing on the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, we will take steps to ensure that the move to individual electoral registration does not leave millions unregistered,",202,791
nor lead to constituencies that fail to take into account the people who live in them.,202,792
"This will include block registration by universities and care homes,",202,793
"extending Northern Irelands successful Schools Initiative,",202,794
and exploring the scope for an automatic system of registration.,202,795
Labour remains committed to reforming political party funding and taking the big money out of politics by capping individual donations to parties.,202,796
"We will safeguard our democracy by repealing the Lobbying Act, which has gagged charities, and replace it with a tougher statutory register of lobbyists.",202,797
We will ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies.,202,798
And we will reform the legislative process to strengthen the publics voice and to better hold the government to account.,202,799
Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the common good.,601,801
"But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union now needs to evolve.",204,802
"As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.",204,803
"Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions,",204,804
"to represent every part of the United Kingdom,",202,805
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber.,202,806
It is also time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of legislation that only affects England.,204,807
"This includes the option put forward by Sir William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs.",204,808
These ideas must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process.,204,809
We will embark on the biggest devolution of power to our English city and county regions in a hundred years with an English Devolution Act.,301,811
"It will transfer £30 billion of funding to city and county regions, along with new powers over economic development, skills, employment, housing, and business support.",301,812
"This will include control over local transport systems so that in future, local bodies can integrate trains, buses, trams and cycling into a single network.",301,813
We will enable city and county regions to retain 100 per cent of additional business rates raised from growth in their area.,301,814
"Fair funding will be restored across England, alongside longer term multi-year budgets, so that local authorities can plan ahead on the basis of need in their area and protect vital services.",301,815
"And an English Regional Cabinet Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, will be convened regularly, attended by the relevant Secretaries of State and leaders of our major city and county regions.",301,816
"In return for greater devolution of funding and responsibility, we will establish local Public Accounts Committees, so that every pound spent by local bodies creates value for money for local taxpayers.",301,817
Devolution does not end at town halls.,301,818
"Local people know best about the complex problems they face, and they are best placed to work out how to solve them.",301,819
The English New Deal begins the process of giving individuals and communities more power and control over how they are governed and over the design of their public services.,301,820
"It will support people who need care to live independently,",503,821
"help troubled families to turn their lives around,",503,822
and make sure that every child has a good start in life with early-years intervention and quality childcare.,503,823
We will give English people a stronger voice in shaping the future of their local NHS services.,504,824
"Patients and the public will have a seat at the table from the very start of any process that draws up plans for change, including changes to hospital services.",504,825
"We will give local communities more power to shape their high streets, and so preserve their local identities.",301,826
"Councils will be given the power to require particular types of shops to apply for planning permission, allowing them to restrict the number of payday lenders or other shops that are clustering on a single high street.",301,827
Communities will be able to review betting shop licenses in their area and reduce the number of fixed-odds betting terminals in existing betting shops  or ban them entirely  in response to local concerns.,301,828
"In September 2014, people across Scotland voted overwhelmingly for change.",301,830
Labour will keep its vow and implement the Smith Agreement in full.,301,831
"And we will go further, with a Home Rule Bill to give extra powers to Scotland over tax, welfare and jobs.",301,832
Rates of income tax will be set in Scotland.,301,833
"Billions of pounds of social security spending will be devolved, including benefits that support disabled people",301,834
The Work Programme will also be devolved along with a greater ability to invest in capital projects.,301,835
The new devolution settlement will recognise the strength and security offered by being part of the United Kingdom.,301,836
"We will maintain the Barnett formula,",301,837
and Scotland will continue to benefit from pooling and sharing resources across the UK.,301,838
"Labour will put Welsh devolution on the same statutory basis as Scottish devolution, with a clear principle that powers are devolved unless specifically reserved,",301,840
and that a Welsh legislature is a permanent feature of our constitutional arrangements.,301,841
"We will take forward proposals from the Silk Commission to extend the power the people of Wales have over their elections, transport and energy.",301,842
An all-Wales Policing Plan will give the Welsh people the ability to shape local policing in Wales.,301,843
Wales must not be unfairly disadvantaged by the Barnett formula.,301,844
"So while the Conservatives have cut the Welsh budget by £1.5 billion, we will establish a fair funding settlement for Wales, with the guarantee of a funding floor.",301,845
"Labour is proud of the role we played in bringing peace and stability to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, and successive agreements.",106,847
"A Labour Government will engage proactively with the Northern Ireland Executive to support continued political progress, and deliver on its vision of a shared future.",301,848
We will ensure the economic pact between the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive is focused on stimulating jobs and growth which contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Northern Ireland.,410,849
We will continue to work with the Irish Government to secure peace in Northern Ireland and strengthen relations between our two countries.,106,850
The Labour Party has always led on challenging prejudice and discrimination and we will continue to do so.,503,852
People's differences are not excuses to treat them badly or unjustly.,503,853
"The next Labour Government will go further in reducing discrimination against women,",503,854
requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gap,503,855
and strengthening the law against maternity discrimination.,503,856
"Where there is evidence more progress is needed, we will enforce the relevant provisions within the Equality Act.",503,857
We want our Parliament to look more like Britain.,503,858

"ethnic minorities,",503,860
and other under-represented groups in politics and public life.,503,861
"We remain committed to achieving a better balance in Parliament, including through the use of all-women shortlists in Labour Party parliamentary selection contests.",503,862
We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities.,503,863
"Our aim is to make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary, civil service, and the boardrooms of our companies, are more representative of our diverse country.",503,864
"We will also build on our history of championing LGBT rights, tackling homophobia with tougher laws at home and greater engagement abroad.",503,865
"Britain has a long tradition of liberty and the rule of law,",601,866
"and Labour has a proud record of extending these to our most vulnerable citizens, by promoting equality and opportunity for all.",503,867
"Thanks to the Human Rights Act, some of our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled people and victims of crime, have been given a powerful means of redress.",201,868
"The Conservatives want to leave the European Convention of Human Rights, and abolish the Human Rights Act.",201,869
"A Labour Government will stand up for citizens individual rights, protecting the Human Rights Act and reforming, rather than walking away from, the European Court of Human Rights.",201,870
"And we will make sure that access to legal representation, a cornerstone of our democracy, is not determined by personal wealth, but remains available to those that need it.",202,871
Our Freedom of Information laws have shone a light into the darker corners of government and are a crucial check on the power of the Executive.,202,872
We will extend their scope so that public services run by large private companies are included.,202,873
And we will repair the damage done by this Government to the vital safeguard offered by judicial review.,202,874
The free flow of information and of different points of view is crucial for open debate and countering concentrations of unaccountable power.,201,876
That is why the concentration of media power in too few hands is damaging to our democracy.,202,877
No one media owner should be able to exert undue influence on public opinion and policy makers.,202,878
No media company should have so much power that those who run it believe themselves above the rule of law.,202,879
Yet the current system for protecting against these threats is inadequate.,202,880
"Labour will take steps to protect the principle of media plurality, so that no media outlet can get too big, including updating our rules for the 21st century media environment.",202,881
We remain strongly committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.,201,882
"We expect the industry to establish a mechanism for independent self-regulation, which delivers proper redress for individuals, as set out in the Royal Charter, and agreed by all parties in Parliament.",201,883
We made a promise to victims of the phone hacking scandal.,201,884
We stand by that promise and will keep it.,201,885
Our system of public service broadcasting is one of Britains great strengths.,601,886
"The BBC makes a vital contribution to the richness of our cultural life,",502,887
and we will ensure that it continues to do so while delivering value for money.,502,888
"We will also commit to keeping Channel 4 in public ownership,",413,889

"We will strengthen our national security,",104,907
"stand up for human rights,",201,908
"and work with other countries to tackle terrorism,",107,909
"climate change,",501,910
and eliminate extreme poverty globally.,107,911
Britain has a unique influence in the world.,601,912
"We are the only country that is a member of the UN Security Council, NATO, the G7, the G20, the Commonwealth and the EU.",107,913
"With Labour, Britains response to threats to our security will be based on enduring principles.",104,914
"We will protect our national interests, and strengthen our long-standing international alliances, in particular, our membership of NATO",104,915
and the European Union.,108,916
"We will advance our international engagement, rather than retreating into isolation.",107,917
"We will maintain the best Armed Forces in the world,",104,918
capable of responding to changing threats in an unpredictable security landscape.,104,919
"And we will support human rights, always putting individual freedom and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.",201,920

We will take a multilateral approach to global challenges.,107,923
We will continue to uphold our key alliances.,107,924

"Labour will continue to advocate an EU which looks outward to promote stability, peace and prosperity on its borders.",108,930
Most immediately we will work with our allies to counter and confront terrorism.,104,931
"ISILs barbarism and expansionist ideology, alongside terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, represent a particular threat to global security.",104,932
"Following a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister, it was right that the UK joined other nations in air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq.",104,933
But military action alone will not defeat ISIL.,105,934
"A long-term multinational political strategy, with regional actors playing a central role, is essential for tackling the rise of extremism across the region.",107,935
A Labour Government will always do what is necessary to defend our country.,104,936
"Beyond self-defence, Labour has been clear about the need to learn the lessons of previous interventions, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq.",105,937
We will continue the approach we have taken in this Parliament.,105,938
"A Labour Government would not propose the use of military force without judging whether reasonable diplomatic efforts have been exhausted,",105,939
"the action is proportionate and in partnership with allies,",105,940
"whether there is a clear legal basis,",105,941
"and if there is a clear plan, not just for winning the war but also for building a lasting peace.",105,942
Peace and security in the Middle East are one of Labours most important foreign policy objectives.,106,943
We remain committed to a comprehensive two-state solution  a secure Israel alongside a viable and independent state of Palestine.,106,944
There can be no military solution to this conflict and all sides must avoid taking action that would make peace harder to achieve.,106,945
Labour will continue to press for an immediate return to meaningful negotiations leading to a diplomatic resolution.,106,946
Labour will also continue to honour the UKs commitment to support Afghanistan as it seeks to secure an inclusive and durable political settlement.,107,947
"In December 2014, the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan ended.",107,948
We can never repay the debt owed to the brave servicemen and women who have sacrificed and risked their lives in Afghanistan to protect our national security.,104,949
"As power and wealth continues to shift from West to East, our relationship with Asia will be fundamental to our long-term prosperity.",107,950
"Labour will set up an Asia Step-Change Taskforce to ensure a more strategic and effective dialogue with regional partners, including China,",107,951
"both in the commerical realm,",107,952
"and in other areas, from cultural exchange  to human rights.",201,953
This commitment to universal human rights will be at the heart of our foreign policy across the world.,201,954
We will continue to promote womens rights.,201,955
"We will join with those campaigning to attain gender equality, the eradication of poverty and inclusive economic growth.",201,956

Labour believes that our membership of the European Union is central to our prosperity and security.,108,961
"It is why we will work to change the EU, so that it operates in the best interests of our country.",108,962
And it is why we will re-engage with our European allies to protect our national interest after five years of Britain being sidelined in Europe and isolated abroad.,108,963
The economic case for membership of the EU is overwhelming.,108,964
"Over 3 million jobs in the UK are linked to trade with the European Union,",108,965
and almost half of our trade and foreign investment comes from the EU.,108,966
"Competing in the single market, with the best companies in the world, drives competitiveness and innovation for firms in all parts of our economy.",108,967
"And it helps boost the living standards of people across Britain, encouraging the inflow of capital and investment.",108,968
"Our reforms will help deliver a Europe focused on jobs and growth, not simply more austerity and rising unemployment.",108,969
"` Labour will focus on the completion of the single market and tougher budget discipline,",108,970
`including on those items where spending at the EU level can save money at the national level.,108,971
That means driving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy,108,972
`and a Commission-led zero-based review of spending on EU agencies to reduce waste and inefficiency.,108,973
"`We will not join the Euro, and we will ensure EU rules protect the interests of non-Euro members.",108,974
"A Labour Government helped to introduce sensible measures at EU level to protect the rights of British workers, and we remain committed to fighting to protect these measures.",108,976
"People coming to Britain from the EU to look for work are expected to contribute to our economy, and to our society.",108,978
` So we will secure reforms to immigration,108,979
"and social security rules, as well as pushing for stronger transitional controls, which will enable member states to manage the flow of workers for longer when new countries join.",108,980
"We will also continue to open up EU decision-making, and implement institutional reforms to help build levels of trust among European citizens.",108,981
"We will work to strengthen the influence national parliaments over European legislation, by arguing for a red-card mechanism for member states, providing greater parliamentary scrutiny.",108,982
Labours priority in government will be protecting the NHS,504,983
and tackling the cost-of-living crisis.,409,984
It is not to take Britain out of Europe.,108,985
"However, Labour will legislate for a lock that guarantees that there can be no transfer of powers from Britain to the European Union without the consent of the British public through an in/out referendum.",202,986
The primary duty of any government is the defence of the nation and its interests.,104,988
"That is why Labour is committed to ensuring the UK has responsive, high-tech Armed Forces, with the capability to respond to emerging, interconnected threats, in an unpredictable security landscape.",104,989
"We will conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of government, with an inclusive national debate on the security and defence challenges facing the country.",104,990
"It will be fiscally responsible and strategically driven, focusing on the obstacles that impede our Armed Forces from effective response to threats.",104,991

"We will introduce legislation to make discrimination against members of our Armed Forces illegal,",503,996

"The UK defence and security industry is a key contributor to our economy, with a turnover of £22 billion a year.",104,998
"We will work to secure defence jobs across the UK,",104,999
protect the supply chain and support industry to grow Britains defence exports.,104,1000
"In partnership with industry, we will put accountability, value for money, interoperability and sustainability at the centre of defence procurement.",104,1001
Britain needs to be prepared to counter the threat of cyber-attacks.,104,1002
"We have already called on the Government to require every company working with the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, to sign up to a cyber-security charter.",104,1003
This would reduce the risk of hackers using small suppliers to break into the systems of major defence companies or the department itself.,104,1004
"We will consult on creating a statutory requirement for all private companies, to report serious cyber-attacks threatening our national infrastructure.",104,1005
"Labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear capability, delivered through a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent.",104,1006

We will put climate change at the heart of our foreign policy.,501,1010
"As the terrible impact of the floods in Britain showed last year, climate change is now an issue of national, as well as global security.",501,1011
"From record droughts in California, to devastating typhoons in the Philippines, the world is already seeing the effects we once thought only future generations would experience.",501,1012
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear that if the world is going to hold warming below two degrees (the internationally-agreed goal), global emissions need to peak in around 2020, and then decline rapidly to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this century.",501,1013
"The weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the reductions will need to be later.",501,1014
"The effects of climate change hit the poor, the hardest.",501,1015
"If we do not tackle climate change, millions of people will fall into poverty.",501,1016

and support sustainable livelihoods for the worlds poorest people.,416,1018
"We want an ambitious agreement on climate change at the UNFCCC conference in Paris, in December.",501,1019
"We will make the case for ambitious emissions targets for all countries, strengthened every five years on the basis of a scientific assessment of the progress towards the below two degree goal.",501,1020
"And we will push for a goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century,",501,1021
"for transparent and universal rules for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions,",501,1022
and for an equitable deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in combatting climate change.,501,1023
We are proud that Labour MPs passed the historic law that commits Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on international development.,107,1025

"We will work with other countries at this years Sustainable Development Goals Summit to unite the world to eradicate extreme poverty,",107,1031
"tackle growing economic inequality,",107,1032
and place human rights at the heart of development.,201,1033
"We will establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage to provide the support, encouragement, and global partnerships needed to help countries provide free healthcare.",107,1034
We will lead efforts to reshape the UN humanitarian system to better equip it to save lives.,107,1035

"We will extend the sharing of tax information to developing countries, increase DFIDs help to governments to collect more of their own taxes,",107,1037
"tackle corruption,",304,1038

push for an ambitious target in Paris to get to goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century.,501,1050
Time for change  In this election the country has a choice.,503,1051
"Either we can carry on as we are, with an economy that might work for some in the City of London but shuts out millions of people in the rest of the country.",503,1052
A country in which young people are left facing a worse life than their parents and an NHS under huge strain faces a real threat to its future.,504,1053
"Or we can change direction, together, with Labour.",503,1054
We don't promise the earth.,503,1055
"All our commitments in this manifesto are fully funded, so they can be delivered without a penny of borrowing.",414,1056
But our policies will bring hope and make Britain work for working people once again.,403,1057
Working people want an economy with better jobs and higher skills.,701,1058
Families want to know they are guaranteed decent schools and good healthcare.,503,1059

and for those in power to be held to account.,202,1062
"Everyone, young and old, wants a sense of belonging and safety in their communities.",606,1063
"We deserve a country where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the top.",503,1064
That's what this manifesto offers.,503,1065
It is the kind of country we know we have it in ourselves to be.,503,1066
Let's build it together.,503,1067
"Labours economic strategy is about delivering a fairer, more prosperous society for the many, not just the few.",503,2
"We will measure our economic success not by the number of billionaires, but by the ability of our people to live richer lives.",503,3
"Labour understands that the creation of wealth is a collective endeavour between workers, entrepreneurs, investors and government.",405,4
Each contributes and each must share fairly in the rewards.,503,5
"This manifesto sets out Labours plan to upgrade our economy and rewrite the rules of a rigged system, so that our economy really works for the many, and not only the few.",503,6
Britain is the only major developed economy where earnings have fallen even as growth has returned after the financial crisis.,701,7
"Most working people in Britain today are earning less, after inflation, than they did ten years ago.",701,8
Too many of us are in low-paid and insecure work.,701,9
Too many of us fear our children will not enjoy the same opportunities that we have.,503,10
Labour will turn this around.,503,11
"We will upgrade our economy, breaking down the barriers that hold too many of us back,",503,12
and tackling the gender pay gap.,503,13
"Our National Transformation Fund will deliver the investment that every part of Britain needs to meet its potential, overcoming years of neglect.",411,14
"Our industrial strategy will support businesses to create new, highskilled, high-paid and secure work across the country, in the sectors of the future such as renewables.",411,15

"The growth created by our national investment plan, underpinned by the responsible economic management embodied in our Fiscal Credibility Rule, will create good jobs,",701,18
drive up living standards,410,19
and improve the public finances.,414,20
"It is a plan that will deliver Labours vision of an economy that works for the many, not just the few",503,21
 a Britain in which no one is held back.,503,22
Taxation is what underpins our shared prosperity.,503,24
"All of us, including business, benefit from a healthy, educated and skilled population, with access to basic services and secure housing.",503,25
We believe in the social obligation to contribute to a fair taxation scheme for the common good.,503,26
"We will take on the social scourge of tax avoidance through our Tax Transparency and Enforcement Programme,",503,27
and close down tax loopholes.,503,28
But we will not ask ordinary households to pay more.,701,29
"A Labour government will guarantee no rises in income tax for those earning below £80,000 a year,",704,30
and no increases in personal National Insurance Contributions or the rate of VAT.,704,31
"Under Labours plans, 95 per cent of taxpayers will be guaranteed no increase in their income tax contributions, and everyone will be protected from any increase in personal National Insurance contributions and VAT.",704,32
Only the top 5 per cent of earners will be asked to contribute more in tax to help fund our public services.,503,33
"We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, childrens clothes, books and newspapers, and public transport fares.",504,34
Corporation tax in the UK is the lowest of any major developed economy.,503,35
Our new settlement with business will ask large corporations to pay a little more while still keeping UK corporation tax among the lowest of the major developed economies.,503,36
"In turn, we will meet the business need for a more skilled workforce with extra corporate tax revenues while contributing to education and skills budgets.",411,37
We will protect small businesses by reintroducing the lower small profits rate of corporation tax.,402,38
We will also exclude small businesses from costly plans to introduce quarterly reporting,402,39
and take action on late payments.,403,40
Labour will give HM Revenue & Customs the resources and skills necessary to clamp down hard on those unscrupulous few individuals and companies who seek to avoid the responsibilities that the rest of us meet.,503,41
"Our manifesto is fully costed, with all current spending paid for out of taxation or redirected revenue streams.",414,43
Our public services must rest on the foundation of sound finances.,414,44
Labour will therefore set the target of eliminating the governments deficit on day-to-day spending within five years.,414,45
"But government must have a laserlike focus on how we earn, as well as how we spend.",410,46
"At the same time as eliminating the current deficit, Labour will invest in our future, to ensure faster growth and help us to earn our way as a country again.",410,47
"To maintain good fiscal health, we will have a firm rule in place to guide all our taxation and spending decisions.",414,48
"Our Fiscal Credibility Rule is based on the simple principle that government should not be borrowing for day-today spending,",414,49
but that future growth depends on investment.,402,50
It was designed in conjunction with worldleading economists.,414,51
It also means we are committed to ensuring that the national debt is lower at the end of the next Parliament than it is today.,414,52
"Compliance with the rule will be overseen by a strengthened and truly independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which we will make accountable to Parliament.",202.1,53
We will also consult on implementing the recommendations of the Kerslake Review of the Treasury.,408,54
"Our country and its people have been held back by a lack of investment in the backbone of a modern economy  the infrastructure of transport, communications and energy systems.",411,56
"And when investment has happened, it has been too concentrated in too few places.",411,57
Labour will make different choices.,411,58
We will take advantage of near- record low interest rates to create a National Transformation Fund that will invest £250 billion over ten years in upgrading our economy.,411,59
We will ensure that the huge potential of every part of our country is met.,503,60
The next Labour government will rebuild communities ripped apart by globalisation and neglected for years by government.,606.1,61
"We will rebuild and transform our economy so that it works for the many, not the few.",503,62
So we will put in place tight rules to ensure that investment is fairly shared around every region and nation of the UK.,503,63
We will tear down the barriers that have held too many people back.,503,64
"A Labour government will complete the HS2 high-speed rail line from London through Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester, and then into Scotland, consulting with (and, where necessary, compensating) communities.",411,65
"We will link HS2 with other rail investments, such as Crossrail of the North (tying together our great northern cities) and on to the Durham Freight Centre.",411,66
We will build a new Brighton Main Line for the South East.,411,67
"In London, to ensure our capital continues to prosper, we will build Crossrail 2.",411,68

On day one we will instruct the National Infrastructure Commission to report on how to roll out'ultrafast (300Mbps) across the UK within the next decade.,411,75
"Our economy is suffering from years of neglect by governments that have refused to support our industries, businesses and workers.",408,77
This wasted potential is holding us all back.,410,78
"Inequality has ballooned as the economy has shifted towards low-paid, insecure jobs.",503,79
Britains manufacturing base has declined,410,80
"and we have relied too heavily on the financial sector, centred on London and the South East.",503,81
"And while the South East struggles with a rising cost of living crisis, many northern and coastal towns have watched as their economies and communities are left behind.",503,82
"Britains failure to get all its regional and local economies working can be seen in the deterioration of the countrys current account,",414,83
weak productivity growth,410,84
and underinvestment in infrastructure.,411,85
Britain can only be stronger if every nation and region is given the resources and support to succeed.,301,86
"Only a Labour government with a credible industrial strategy can reach this untapped potential and deliver prosperity to every corner of our country, working with devolved administrations.",301,87
"Our industrial strategy will be built on objective, measurable missions designed to address the great challenges of our times.",411,88
"In meeting these challenges, we will move beyond the narrow approaches of the past, and mobilise the talents and resources of our whole country to deliver an economy fit for the future.",411,89
The first missions set by a Labour government will be to: ensure that 60 per cent of the UKs energy comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030,501,90
create an innovation nation with the highest proportion of highskilled jobs in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 2030.,411,91
We will meet the OECD target of 3 per cent of GDP spent on research and development by 2030.,411,92
In order to create a fertile ground for businesses to achieve these missions Labour will take action across the areas we know are necessary for business and industry to grow:,410,93
Skills - by creating a National Education Service for England.,411,94
Infrastructure  by investing £250 billion over the next ten years.,411,95
UK supply chains - by targeting government support where there are gaps.,403,96
Trade  by negotiating a new deal with Europe that puts jobs and the economy first.,407,97
Procurement  by requiring the best standards on government contracts.,303,98
Research and development  by committing extra research investment.,411,99
Energy costs and security  by capping costs,412,100
and investing in new publicly owned energy provision.,413,101
"While our industrial strategy is one for growth across all sectors, Labour recognises that certain sectors are of strategic significance to the UK economy.",410,102
"For each strategic industry, the next Labour government will establish a council (modelled on the highly successful Automotive Council) to oversee its future security and growth.",404,103
We will also encourage private investment by removing new plant and machinery from business rate calculations.,402,104
National and local government spends £200 billion a year in the privatesector procurement.,303,105
"Labour will put that spending power to good use to upgrade our economy,",411,106
create good local jobs,701,107
and reduce inequality.,503,108
"We will require firms supplying national or local government to meet the high standards we should expect of all businesses: paying their taxes,",503,109
"recognising trade unions,",701,110
"respecting workers rights and equal opportunities,",701,111
"protecting the environment,",501,112
"providing training,",411,113
and paying suppliers on time.,403,114
We will expect suppliers to reduce boardroom pay excesses by moving towards a 20:1 gap between the highest and lowest paid.,503,115
We will appoint a Digital Ambassador to liaise with technology companies to promote Britain as an attractive place for investment and provide support for start-ups to scale up to become world-class digital businesses.,411,116
Our Digital Ambassador will help to ensure businesses are ready to grow and prosper in the digital age.,411,117
"A decade after the devastating international financial crisis, our financial system is still holding back too many of our small businesses and local economies.",403,119
Labour will transform how our financial system operates.,408,120
"Following the successful example of Germany and the Nordic countries, we will establish a National Investment Bank that will bring in private capital finance to deliver £250 billion of lending power.",413,121
"This new public institution will support a network of regional development banks that, unlike giant City of London firms, will be dedicated to supporting inclusive growth in their communities.",416.2,122
"The banks will deliver the finance that our small businesses, co-operatives and innovative projects need across the whole country.",403,123
"The National Investment Bank will fill existing gaps in lending by private banks, particularly to small businesses,",402,124
"and by providing patient, long-term finance to R&D-intensive investments.",404,125
"It will also be given the task of helping to deliver our industrial strategy, by prioritising spending in line with its objectives.",411,126
"Labour will overhaul the regulation of our financial system,",412,127
putting in place a firm ring-fence between investment and retail banking that will protect consumers.,403,128
"We will take a new approach to the publicly-owned RBS, and launch a consultation on breaking up the bank to create new local public banks that are better matched to their customers needs.",412,129
"And we will extend existing Stamp Duty Reserve Tax to cover a wider range of assets, ensuring that the public gets a fairer share of financial system profits.",503,130
"Labour will change the law so that banks cant close a branch where there is a clear local need, putting their customers first.",403,131
"Britain has a successful international finance industry, but we also need a strong, safe and socially useful banking system to meet the needs of our own regional economies and communities.",416.2,132
"We will commit to creating a more diverse banking system, backed up by legislation.",403,133
"The majority of businesses play by the rules: they pay their taxes and their workers reasonably and on time, and they operate with respect for the environment and local communities.",416.2,135
"That is why it is vital that government ensures that businesses doing the right thing are rewarded rather than undercut or outbid by those unscrupulous few that cut corners, whether on taxes, workers conditions, environmental standards, or consumer safety and protection.",416.2,136
But our business culture doesnt always work like this.,416.2,137
Scandals such as the failure of BHS show how the longterm growth of a company can be sacrificed for the sake of a quick buck.,416.2,138
"When shareholders are looking for quick short-term returns, they encourage companies to cut corners.",416.2,139
"That means they look to cut wages, instead of investing for the long term, or they spend longer inventing new tax avoidance schemes than they do inventing new products.",416.2,140
"By reforming the rules our companies operate under, we can make sure they stay focused on delivering shared wealth.",503,141
"Labour will amend company law so that directors owe a duty directly not only shareholders, but to employees, customers, the environment and the wider public, and we will consult on bringing forward appropriate legislation within this Parliament.",416.2,142
Labour will amend the takeover regime to ensure that businesses identified as being'systemically important have a clear plan in place to protect workers and pensioners when a company is taken over.,403,143
Labour will also legislate to reduce pay inequality by introducing an Excessive Pay Levy on companies with staff on very high pay.,503,144
"Our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of our economy, providing 60 per cent of private-sector jobs.",402,145
"Technological changes, like the spread of digital manufacturing and rapid communication, mean smaller, faster businesses will be the future of our economy.",402,146
Yet this Conservative Government has taken small businesses for granted.,402,147
Labour is the party of small businesses.,402,148
We understand the challenges our smaller businesses face.,402,149
"In order to provide the support many small businesses need, a Labour government will: Mandate the new National Investment Bank, and regional development banks in every region, to identify where other lenders fail to meet the needs of SMEs and prioritise lending to improve the funding gap.",402,150
Reinstate the lower small-business corporation tax rate.,402,151
"Introduce a package of reforms to business rates  including switching from RPI to CPI indexation,",402,152
"exempting new investment in plant and machinery from valuations,",402,153
and ensuring that businesses have access to a proper appeals process,402,154
 while reviewing the entire business rates system in the longer run.,402,155
"Scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under £85,000.",402,156
Declare war on late payments by: Using government procurement to ensure that anyone bidding for a government contract pays its own suppliers within 30 days.,403,157
Developing a version of the Australian system of binding arbitration and fines for persistent late-payers for the private and public sectors.,403,158
We will also bring forward legislation to create a proper legal definition for co-operative ownership.,403,159
The National Investment Bank and regional development banks will be charged with helping support our co-operative sector.,404,160
"Labour will aim to double the size of the co-operative sector in the UK, putting it on a par with those in leading economies like Germany or the US.",404,161
Britain is a long-established democracy.,202.1,163
But the distribution of ownership of the countrys economy means that decisions about our economy are often made by a narrow elite.,202.1,164
More democratic ownership structures would help our economy deliver for the many and lead to a fairer distribution of wealth.,503,165
"In government, Labour would give more people a stake  and a say -  in our economy by doubling the size of the co-operative sector and introducing a right to own, making employees the buyer of first refusal when the company they work for is up for sale.",202.1,166
We will act to insource our public and local council services as preferred providers.,413,167
Many basic goods and services have been taken out of democratic control through privatisation.,413,168
"This has often led to higher prices and poorer quality, as prices are raised to pay out dividends.",413,169
"For example, water bills have increased 40 per cent since privatisation, and our private energy providers overcharged customers by £2 billion in 2015.",413,170
"In private hands, Royal Mail has increased stamp and parcel charges, and failed to meet its customer service obligations, while its owners trade shares at significant profit.",413,171
"The Conservative Governments privatisation of Royal Mail was a historic mistake, selling off another national asset on the cheap.",413,172
"Across the world, countries are taking public utilities back into public ownership.",413,173
"Labour will learn from these experiences and bring key utilities back into public ownership to deliver lower prices, more accountability and a more sustainable economy.",413,174
We will: Bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expire.,413,175
"Regain control of energy supply networks through the alteration of operator license conditions, and transition to a publicly owned, decentralised energy system.",413,176
Replace our dysfunctional water system with a network of regional publicly-owned water companies.,413,177
Reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail at the earliest opportunity.,413,178
"Public ownership will benefit consumers, ensuring that their interests are put first and that there is democratic accountability for the service.",413,179
Labours energy policy is built on three simple principles: ·To ensure security of energy supply and keep the lights on.,411,181
To ensure energy costs are affordable for consumers and businesses.,412,182
To ensure we meet our climate change targets and transition to a low-carbon economy.,501,183
"The UK energy system is outdated, expensive and polluting.",411,184
"Privatisation has failed to deliver an energy system that delivers for people, businesses or our environment.",413,185
"One in ten households are in fuel poverty, yet the Competition Markets Authority found customers are overcharged an enormous £2 billion every year.",412,186
"Labour understands that many people dont have time to shop around, they just want reliable and affordable energy.",412,187
"So the next Labour Government will: ·Introduce an immediate emergency price cap to ensure that the average dual-fuel household energy bill remains below £1,000 per year, while we transition to a fairer system for bill payers.",412,188
"Take energy back into public ownership to deliver renewable energy, affordability for consumers, and democratic control.",413,189
We will do this in the following stages: · Regaining control of energy supply networks through the alteration of the National and Regional Network Operator license conditions.,413,190
"Supporting the creation of publicly owned, locally accountable energy companies and co-operatives to rival existing private energy suppliers, with at least one if every region.",413,191
"Legislating to permit publicly owned local companies to purchase the regional grid infrastructure,",413,192
and to ensure that national and regional grid infrastructure is brought into public ownership over time.,413,193
Labour will insulate four million homes as an infrastructure priority to help those who suffer in cold homes each winter.,411,194
"This will cut emissions,",501,195
"improve health,",504,196
"save on bills,",504,197
and reduce fuel poverty and winter deaths.,504,198
Homeowners will be offered interestfree loans to improve their property.,411,199
"For renters, Labour will improve on existing Landlord Energy Efficiency regulations and re-establish the Landlord Energy Saving Allowance to encourage the uptake of efficiency measures.",411,200
"Labour will ban fracking because it would lock us into an energy infrastructure based on fossil fuels, long after the point in 2030 when the Committee on Climate Change says gas in the UK must sharply decline.",501,201
Emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage will help to smooth the transition to cleaner fuels,501,202
and to protect existing Jobs as part of the future energy mix.,701,203
"To safeguard the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a strategy focused on protecting vital North Sea assets, and thejobs and skills that depend on them.",411,204
"We are committed to renewable energy projects, including tidal lagoons, which can help create manufacturing and energy jobs",701,205
as well as contributing to climatechange commitments.,501,206
"The UK has the worlds oldest nuclear industry, and nuclear will continue to be part of the UK energy supply.",411,207
We will support further nuclear projects and protect nuclear workers Jobs and pensions.,701,208
There are considerable opportunities for nuclear power and decommissioning both internationally and domestically.,411,209
"Building a clean economy of the future is the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and future generations.",501,210
Yet recent years have seen a failure to progress towards our targets.,501,211
A Labour government will put us back on track to meet the targets in the Climate Change Act and the Paris Agreement.,501,212
"The low-carbon economy is one of the UKs fastest-growing sectors, creating jobs and providing investment across each region.",411,213
"It employed an estimated 447,000 employees in the UK in 2015 and saw over £77 billion in turnover.",411,214
"With backing from a Labour government, these sectors can secure crucial shares of global export markets.",411,215
"Currently, the UK buys and sells energy tariff free from Europe, an arrangement which saves families and businesses money, and helps balance the power grid.",407,216
"As part of the Brexit negotiations, Labour will prioritise maintaining access to the internal energy market.",407,217
"Labour will also retain access to Euratom, to allow continued trade of fissile material, with access and collaboration over research vital to our nuclear industry.",411,218
Labour accepts the referendum result,110,220
and a Labour government will put the national interest first.,601.1,221
"We will prioritise jobs and living standards,",701,222
"build a close new relationship with the EU,",108,223
protect workers rights,701,224
"and environmental standards,",501,225
provide certainty to EU nationals,108,226
and give a meaningful role to Parliament throughout negotiations.,202.1,227
"We will end Theresa Mays reckless approach to Brexit,",305.2,228
and seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain.,606.1,229
"We will scrap the Conservatives Brexit White Paper and replace it with fresh negotiating priorities that have a strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the Single Market and the Customs Union  which are essential for maintaining industries, jobs and businesses in Britain.",108,230
Labour will always put jobs and the economy first.,701,231
A Labour government will immediately guarantee existing rights for all EU nationals living in Britain and secure reciprocal rights for UK citizens who have chosen to make their lives in EU countries.,108,232
EU nationals do not just contribute to our society: they are part of our society.,108,233
And they should not be used as bargaining chips.,108,234
It is shameful that the Prime Minister rejected repeated attempts by Labour to resolve this issue before Article 50 was triggered.,305.2,235
"As a result three million EU nationals have suffered unnecessary uncertainty, as have the 1.2 million UK citizens living in the EU.",108,236
"A Conservative Brexit will weaken workers rights,",701,237
"deregulate the economy,",403,238
"slash corporate taxes,",503,239
"sideline Parliament and democratic accountability,",202.1,240
and cut Britain off from our closest allies and most important trading partners.,108,241
Labour recognises that leaving the EU with no deal is the worst possible deal for Britain and that it would do damage to our economy and trade.,108,242
We will reject no deal as a viable option and if needs be negotiate transitional arrangements to avoid a 'cliff-edge for the UK economy.,108,243
"The issues that affect our continent now will continue to do so in the future  and Labour will continue to work constructively with the EU and other European nations on issues such as climate change, refugee crises and counter-terrorism.",108,244
"We will build a close co-operative future relationship with the EU, not as members but as partners.",108,245
A Labour government will ensure that the UK maintains our leading research role by seeking to stay part of Horizon 2020 and its successor programmes and by welcoming research staff to the UK.,108,246
We will seek to maintain membership of (or equivalent relationships with) European organisations which offer benefits to the UK such as Euratom and the European Medicines Agency.,108,247
We will seek to ensure that Britain remains part of the Erasmus scheme so that British students have the same educational opportunities after we leave the EU.,108,248
"The EU is the UKs single largest trading partner in agricultural produce, with the vast majority of British exports being sold to European markets.",703.1,249
A Labour government will end the uncertainty for our farmers and food producers by securing continued EU market access allowing British farmers and food producers to continue to sell their products on the Continent.,703.1,250
Labour will also protect our farmers and rural economy by ensuring Britain continues to set the highest standards in food quality and welfare.,703.1,251
We will not allow Brexit to be used as an excuse to undercut our farmers and flood Britains food chain with cheap and inferior produce.,703.1,252
"We will drop the Conservatives Great Repeal Bill, replacing it with an EU Rights and Protections Bill that will ensure there is no detrimental change to workers rights,",701,253
"equality law,",503,254
consumer rights,403,255
or environmental protections as a result of Brexit.,501,256
"Throughout the Brexit process, we will make sure that all EU-derived laws that are of benefit - including workplace laws, consumer rights and environmental protections  are fully protected without qualifications, limitations or sunset clauses.",108,257
"We will work with trade unions, businesses and stakeholders to ensure there is a consensus on this vital issue.",405,258
A Labour approach to Brexit will ensure there can be no rolling back of key rights and protections,201.2,259
and that the UK does not lag behind Europe in workplace protections,701,260
and environmental standards in future.,501,261
The EU has had a huge impact in securing workplace protections and environmental safeguards.,108,262
"But we all know that for many Brexiteers in the Tory Party, this was why they wanted to Leave  to tear up regulations",403,263
and weaken hard-fought rights and protections.,201.2,264
A Labour government will never consider these rights a burden,201.2,265
"or accept the weakening of workers rights,",701,266
consumer rights,403,267
or environmental protections.,501,268
We will introduce legislation to ensure there are no gaps in national security and criminal justice arrangements as a result of Brexit.,605.1,269
Labour recognises the vital role that cross-border agencies such as Eurojust and Europol have played in making Britain safer and that European Arrest Warrants have been invaluable.,108,270
A Labour government will seek to retain membership of these agencies and continue European Arrest Warrant arrangements.,108,271
Labour will seek a Brexit deal that delivers for all regions and nations of the UK.,301,272
We will introduce a presumption of devolution where devolved powers transferred from the EU will go straight to the relevant region or nation.,301,273
"For many people and for much of our country, power can feel just as remote and unaccountable in Westminster as it does in Brussels.",301,274
So a Labour government will seek to put powers as close to communities as possible.,301,275
We will ensure there is no drop in EU Structural Funding as a result of Brexit until the end of the current EU funding round in 2019/20.,108,276
"As part of Labours plans to rebalance and rebuild the economy, we will ensure that no region or nation of the UK is affected by the withdrawal of EU funding for the remainder of this Parliament.",408,277
This will also apply to the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.,301,278
We will also improve engagement and dialogue with the devolved administrations and seek to ensure the final Brexit deal addresses specific concerns.,301,279
In particular Labour will ensure there is no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,101,280
and that there is no change in the status or sovereignty of Gibraltar.,101,281
We will also protect Gibraltars economy and ensure that its government can continue to create jobs and prosperity in the years to come.,101,282
"Where Theresa May wants to shut down scrutiny and challenge, Labour will welcome it.",305.1,283
"We will work with Parliament, not against it.",202.1,284
On an issue of this importance the Government cant hide from the public or Parliament.,202.1,285
A Labour approach to Brexit also means legislating to guarantee that Parliament has a truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.,202.1,286
Labour offers fair rules and reasonable management of migration.,602.2,288
"In trade negotiations our priorities favour growth, jobs and prosperity.",410,289
We make no apologies for putting these aims before bogus immigration targets.,602.2,290
Freedom of movement will end when we leave the European Union.,602.2,291
"Britains immigration system will change, but Labour will not scapegoat migrants nor blame them for economic failures.",602.2,292
Labour will develop and implement fair immigration rules.,602.2,293
We will not discriminate between people of different races or creeds.,503,294
We will end indefinite detentions,201.2,295
and distinguish between migrant labour and family attachment,602.2,296
and will continue to support the work of the Forced Marriage Unit.,201.2,297
We will replace income thresholds with a prohibition on recourse to public funds.,602.2,298
"New rules will be equally informed by negotiations with the EU and other partners, including the Commonwealth.",107,299
"Whatever our trade arrangements, we will need new migration management systems, transparent and fair to everybody.",303,300
"Working with businesses, trade unions, devolved governments and others to identify specific labour and skill shortages.",405,301
"Working together we will institute a new system which is based on our economic needs, balancing controls and existing entitlements.",411,302
"This may include employer sponsorship, work permits, visa regulations or a tailored mix of all these which works for the many, not the few.",503,303
"Labour will protect those already working here, whatever their ethnicity.",607.2,304
Our National Education Service will raise the level of skills and training.,411,305
We will take decisive actions to end the exploitation of migrant labour undercutting workers pay and conditions.,701,306
Labour will crack down on unscrupulous employers.,701,307
"We will stop overseas-only recruitment practices,",701,308
strengthen safety-atwork inspections,701,309
and increase prosecutions of employers evading the minimum wage.,701,310
"Working with trade unions, we will end workplace exploitation.",701,311
Labour values the economic,410,312
and social contributions of immigrants.,607.2,313
Both public and private sector employers depend on immigrants.,410,314
We will not denigrate those workers.,410,315
"We value their contributions, including their tax contributions.",705,316
For areas where immigration has placed a strain on public services we will reinstate the Migrant Impact Fund and boost it with a contributory element from the investments required for High Net Worth Individual Visas.,504,317
"Labour will restore the rights of migrant domestic workers, and end this form of modern slavery.",201.2,318
Labour will ease the underlying pressures in any areas struggling to cope with seven years of austerity by our programme of investments.,504,319
We will not cut public services and pretend the cuts are a consequence of immigration.,504,320
Refugees are not migrants.,201.2,321
"They have been forced from their homes, by war, famine or other disasters.",201.2,322
"Unlike the Tories, we will uphold the proud British tradition of honouring the spirit of international law and our moral obligations by taking our fair share of refugees.",201.2,323
The current arrangements for housing and dispersing refugees are not fit for purpose.,201.2,324
They are not fair to refugees or to our communities.,201.2,325
We will review these arrangements.,201.2,326
"Labour welcomes international students who benefit and strengthen our education sector, generating more than £25 billion for the British economy and significantly boosting regional jobs and local businesses.",602.2,327
"They are not permanent residents and we will not include them in immigration numbers,",602.2,328
but we will crack down on fake colleges.,601.2,329
Labour is pro-trade and pro-investment.,407,331
The UKs future prosperity depends on minimising tariff and non-tariff barriers that prevent us from exporting and creating the jobs and economic growth we need.,407,332
"A Labour government will work with devolved administrations to bring forward an integrated trade and industrial strategy that boosts exports,",407,333
investment,410,334
and decent jobs in Britain.,701,335
Labour will set out our priorities in an International Trade White Paper to lead a national debate on the future of Britains trade policy.,407,336
We will ensure proper transparency and parliamentary scrutiny of all future trade and investment deals.,202.1,337
The EU accounts for 44 per cent of our current exports and will continue to be a priority trading partner.,108,338
As our trading relationship with the EU changes it is vital that we retain unrestricted access for our goods and services.,407,339
"Through our Just Trading initiative launched in 2016, Labour will work with global trading partners to develop 'best-in-class free trade and investment agreements that remove trade barriers and promote skilled jobs and high standards.",407,340
We will ensure all future trade deals safeguard the right to regulate in the public interest and to protect public services.,403,341
Labour is committed to the rules-based international trading system of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).,407,342
"We will rejoin the Government Procurement Agreement,",407,343
whilst safeguarding the capacity for public bodies to make procurement decisions in keeping with public policy objectives.,403,344
Labour will build human rights and social justice into trade policy.,416.2,345
"We will ensure that trade agreements cannot undermine human rights and labour standards,",416.2,346
and that UK Export Finance support is not available to companies engaged in bribery or corrupt practices.,416.2,347
We will work with other WTO members to end the dumping of state-subsidised goods on our markets.,406,348
The Conservatives consistently blocked EU efforts to respond to such dumping with the duties needed to defend the British steel industry.,406,349
Labour will develop the full range of trade remedies necessary to support key sectors affected by these unfair practices.,406,350
"Labour will champion the export interests of SMEs, ensuring all new trade agreements include a commitment to support their market access needs.",402,351
"We will develop an export incentive scheme for SMEs based on international best practice,",402,352
and we will ring-fence Tradeshow Access Programme grants to help SMEs reach new customers around the world.,402,353
"Labour will use the full range of export credit, finance, insurance and trade promotion tools to boost British exports and support priority industrial sectors.",410,354

whilst maintaining strong data protection rules to protect personal privacy.,201.1,358
"As part of our commitment to a low-carbon future, we will actively support international negotiations towards an Environmental Goods Agreement at the WTO.",501,359
"Labour will use trade negotiations to boost market access for British environmental goods and services,",407,360
alongside support for investment into new green technologies and innovative low-carbon products.,411,361
"Labour will develop capital investment schemes and other incentives to encourage investment into the UK, especially into target areas identified by the industrial strategy.",402,362

Labour opposes parallel investor-state dispute systems for multinational corporations and we will open a dialogue with trading partners on alternative options that provide investor protection whilst guaranteeing equality before the law.,403,365
Education is what empowers us all to realise our full potential.,506,367
"When it fails, it isnt just the individual that is held back, but all of us.",606.1,368
"When we invest in people to develop their skills and capabilities, we all benefit from a stronger economy and society.",506,369
"At a time when working lives and the skills our economy needs are changing rapidly, governments have the responsibility to make lifelong learning a reality by giving everyone the opportunity to access education throughout their lives.",506,370
"To meet this responsibility, Labour will create a unified National Education Service (NES) for England to move towards cradle-to-grave learning that is free at the point of use.",506,371
"The NES will be built on the principle that Every Child  and Adult  Matters and will incorporate all forms of education, from early years through to adult education.",506,372
"When the 1945 Labour government established the NHS, it created one of the central institutions of fairness of the 20th century.",503,373
"The NES will do the same for the 21 st, giving people confidence and hope by making education a right, not a privilege,",503,374
and building bridges where the Conservatives build barriers.,503,375
"Currently, there is a gap between the end of maternity leave and the beginning of full-time schooling.",504,377
"This gap can make it difficult for parents, particularly women, to return to work, unless they have access to informal childcare support.",504,378
"There is also extensive evidence that early years education has a major impact on child development, and that time in a formal education setting for young children can improve performance at GCSE and beyond.",506,379
Labour would seek to roll out educational provision for early years children as part of a National Education Service that is truly cradle-to-grave.,506,380
"Labour introduced free childcare hours for parents, which were fully funded and resourced.",504,381
"Under the Conservatives, the free hours entitlement is chronically under-funded, with provision patchy and hard to navigate.",504,382
Many providers now simply refuse to participate in the scheme.,504,383
The result is that many parents arent even getting the hours theyre entitled to.,504,384
"Labour would: · Overhaul the existing childcare system in which subsidies are given directly to parents who often struggle to use them, and transition to a system of high-quality childcare places in mixed environments with direct government subsidy.",504,385
"Maintain current commitments on free hours and make significant capital investment during our first two years of government, to ensure that the places exist to meet demand.",504,386
"Phase in subsidised provision on top of free-hour entitlements, to ensure that everyone has access to affordable childcare, no matter their working pattern.",504,387
"Transition to a qualified, graduate-led workforce, by increasing staff wages and enhancing training opportunities.",504,388
"This will benefit staff, who are among our worst-paid workers,",701,389
and improve child development.,506,390
"Extend the 30 free hours to all twoyear-olds, and move towards making some childcare available for oneyear-olds",504,391
and extending maternity pay to 12 months.,504,392
"Sure Start, and the support it gives to vulnerable and hard-to-reach parents, was one of the great achievements of the previous Labour government, but under the Conservatives 1,200 Sure Start centres have been lost.",504,393
Labour will halt the closures and increase the amount of money available for Sure Start.,504,394
Conservative cuts are starving schools of the funding they need to deliver a first class education.,506,396
Crippling underfunding is driving up class sizes and forcing schools to cut corners.,506,397
"A narrow curriculum and a culture of assessment is driving away teachers, creating a recruitment and retention crisis.",506,398
Labour will not waste money on inefficient free schools and the Conservatives grammar schools vanity project.,506,399
Labour does not want a return to secondary moderns.,506,400
We will also oppose any attempt to force schools to become academies.,506,401
Labours schools policy will be built on the following four foundations: ·Investment  we will make sure schools are properly resourced by reversing the Conservatives cuts and ensuring that all schools have the resources they need.,506,402
"We will introduce a fairer funding formula that leaves no school worse off, while redressing the historical underfunding of certain schools.",506,403
"Labour will also invest in new school buildings, including the phased removal of asbestos from existing schools.",506,404
"Quality  we will drive up standards across the board, learning from examples of best practice, such as Labours London Challenge, to encourage co-operation and strong leadership across schools.",506,405
We and trust in teachers and support staff professionalism to refocus their workload on what happens in the classroom.,506,406
"Accountability  Labour will ensure that all schools are democratically accountable,",202.1,407
including appropriate controls to see that they serve the public interest and their local communities.,606.1,408
"We will require joined-up admissions policies across local schools to enable councils to fulfil their responsibilities on child places,",506,409
to simplify the admissions process for parents,506,410
and to ensure that no child slips through the net.,506,411
"Inclusion  Every child is unique, and a Labour-led education system will enable each to find their learning path through a wide choice of courses and qualifications.",506,412
We will invest in measures to close the attainment gap between children from different backgrounds.,503,413
"To give all children the best start in life, we will reduce class sizes to less than 30 for all five-, six-, and seven-year-olds, and seek to extend that as resources allow.",506,414
"To aid attainment, we will introduce free school meals for all primary school children, paid for by removing the VAT exemption on private school fees.",504,415
"We will abandon plans to reintroduce baseline assessments and launch a commission to look into curriculum and assessment, starting by reviewing Key Stage 1 and 2 SATs.",506,416
"The worlds most successful education systems use more continuous assessment, which avoids teaching for the test.",506,417
"We will tackle the teacher recruitment and retention crisis by ending the public-sector pay cap,",506,418
"giving teachers more direct involvement in the curriculum,",506,419
and tackling rising workloads by reducing monitoring and bureaucracy.,506,420
We will also consult on introducing teacher sabbaticals and placements with industry to encourage interaction between education and industry and introduce broad experiences into the classroom.,506,421
We will reintroduce the Schools Support Staff Negotiating Body and national pay settlements for teachers.,506,422
We will put £150 million back into supporting our children in schools by scrapping the Conservatives nonsensical plans for schools to pay the apprenticeship levy.,506,423
"We will extend schools-based counselling to all schools to improve childrens mental health, at a cost of £90 million per year.",504,424
"And we will deliver a strategy for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) based on inclusivity,",506,425
"and embed SEND more substantially into training for teachers and non-teaching staff, so that staff, children and their parents are properly supported.",506,426
"At a time when technology is changing demand for different kinds of skills, and evolving patterns of work mean that people are more likely to pursue several careers during their working lives, it is crucial that our education system enables people to upskill and retrain over their lifetimes.",411,428
"As part of our dynamic industrial strategy, lifelong training will deliver productivity and growth to the whole economy while transforming the lives of individuals and communities.",411,429
"To ensure that we deliver for every part of the UK, we will devolve responsibility for skills, wherever there is an appetite, to city regions or devolved administrations.",301,430
"Despite claiming to be committed to delivering high-quality training, the Conservatives have ruthlessly cut funding for FE colleges  our main provider of adult and vocational education  and reduced entitlements for adult learners.",411,432
"This has led to diminishing numbers of courses and students, and plunged the sector into crisis.",411,433
"Labour would introduce free, lifelong education in Further Education (FE) colleges, enabling everyone to upskill or retrain at any point in life.",411,434
"Our skills and training sector has been held back by repeated reorganisation, which deprives providers, learners and employers of the consistency they need to assess quality.",411,435
"Labour would abandon Conservative plans to once again reinvent the wheel by building new technical colleges, redirecting the money to increase teacher numbers in the FE sector.",411,436
"We share the broad aims of the Sainsbury Review but would ensure vocational routes incorporate the service sector as well as traditional manufacturing, working in tandem with our broad industrial strategy to deliver for the whole economy.",411,437
"We will improve careers advice and open up a range of routes through, and back into, education, striking a balance between classroom and on-the job training, to ensure students gain both technical and soft skills.",411,438
"To implement the Sainsbury recommendations, we would correct historic neglect of the FE sector by giving the sector the investment  in teachers and facilities  it deserves to become a world-leading provider of adult and vocational education.",411,439
"More specifically, we would: ·Bring funding for 16 to18-year-olds in line with Key Stage 4 baselines, while ensuring that the budget is distributed fairly between colleges and school sixth forms",411,440
Restore the Education Maintenance Allowance for 16 to 18-year-olds from lower and middle income backgrounds,411,441
"Replace Advanced Learner Loans and upfront course fees with direct funding, making FE courses free at the point of use, including English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses.",411,442
Drive up quality and consistency in the FE sector by:,411,443
"Encouraging co-operation and leadership across colleges and sixth forms, improving curriculum breadth and quality",411,444
"Setting a target, backed up by funding, for all FE teaching staff to have a teaching qualification within five years.",411,445
"In recognition of the role played by private-sector providers, we would extend support for training to teachers in the private sector",411,446
Increase capital investment to equip colleges to deliver T-levels and an official pre-apprenticeship trainee programme.,411,447
Employer-led training is the most effective way of meeting our growing skills gap.,411,449
"Labour supports the apprenticeship levy, but will take steps to ensure that every apprenticeship is of a high quality.",411,450
Labour will: · Maintain the apprenticeship levy while taking measures to ensure high quality by requiring the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education to report on an annual basis to the Secretary of State on quality outcomes of completed apprenticeships to ensure they deliver skilled workers for employers and real jobs for apprentices at the end of their training.,411,451
And we will work with the devolved administrations to improve the operation of the levy,301,452
Set a target to double the number of completed apprenticeships at NVQ level 3 by 2022,411,453
"Give employers more flexibility in how the levy is deployed, including allowing the levy to be used for pre-apprenticeship programmes",411,454

Consult on introducing incentives for large employers to over-train numbers of apprentices to fill skills gaps in the supply chain and the wider sector,411,459
Reverse cuts to Unionlearn,701,460
Set up a commission on Lifelong Learning tasked with integrating further and higher education.,411,461
"Labour believes education should be free, and we will restore this principle.",506,463
No one should be put off educating themselves for lack of money or through fear of debt.,503,464
There is a real fear that students are being priced out of university education.,503,465
Last year saw the steepest fall in university applications for 30 years.,506,466
"Since the Conservatives came to power, university tuition fees have been trebled to over £9,000 a year,",506,467
and maintenance grants have been abolished and replaced with loans.,504,468
"The average student now graduates from university, and starts their working life, with debts of £44,000.",706,469
"Labour will reintroduce maintenance grants for university students,",504,470
and we will abolish university tuition fees.,506,471
"University tuition is free in many northern European countries, and under a Labour government it will be free here too.",506,472
Work should provide people with security and fulfilment.,701,474
But for too many people work is insecure and does not make ends meet.,701,475
"The Conservatives boast about the recovery of employment, but our labour market is failing.",701,476
"Real-terms pay is still lower than before the crash,",701,477
and jobs are increasingly low skilled and insecure.,701,478
"A Labour government will invest in enforcement through a new Ministry of Labour,",701,479
and empower workers and their trade unions  because we are stronger when we stand together.,701,480
So we will review the rules on union recognition so that more workers have the security of a union.,701,481
"At the same time as strengthening workers rights, we will make work more fulfilling by using public investment to upgrade our economy and create high-quality jobs.",701,482
"While the Conservatives stand back and allow insecure work to spread, Labour will act to guarantee good jobs and businesses.",701,483
The next Labour government will bring in a 20-point plan for security and equality at work:,701,485
"Give all workers equal rights from day one, whether part-time or full-time, temporary or permanent  so that working conditions are not driven down.",701,486
Ban zero hours contracts  so that every worker gets a guaranteed number of hours each week.,701,487
Legislate to ensure that any employer wishing to recruit labour from abroad does not undercut workers at home  because it causes divisions when one workforce is used against another.,701,488
Repeal the Trade Union Act and roll out sectoral collective bargaining  because the most effective way to maintain good rights at work is collectively through a union.,701,489
Guarantee trade unions a right to access workplaces  so that unions can speak to members and potential members.,701,490
Propose four new public holidays  bringing our country together to mark our four national patron saints days.,701,491
These will be additional to statutory holiday entitlement so that workers in Britain get the same proper breaks as in other countries.,701,492
"Raise the Minimum Wage to the level of the Living Wage (expected to be at least £10 per hour by 2020)  for all workers aged 18 or over, so that work pays.",412,493
End the Public Sector Pay Cap  because public sector workers deserve a pay rise after years of falling wages.,504,494
Amend the takeover code to ensure every takeover proposal has a clear plan in place to protect workers and pensioners  because workers shouldnt suffer when a company is sold.,403,495
Roll out maximum pay ratios of 20:1 in the public sector and in companies bidding for public contracts  because it cannot be right that wages at the top keep rising while everyone elses stagnates.,503,496
Ban unpaid internships  because its not fair for some to get a leg up when others cant afford to.,503,497
Enforce all workers rights to trade union representation at work  so that all workers can be supported when negotiating with their employer.,701,498
Abolish employment tribunal fees  so that people have access to justice.,701,499
Double paid paternity leave to four weeks and increase paternity pay  because fathers are parents too and deserve to spend more time with their new babies.,504,500
Strengthen protections for women against unfair redundancy  because no one should be penalised for having children.,503,501
Hold a public inquiry into blacklisting  to ensure that blacklisting truly becomes and remains a thing of the past.,701,502
Give equalities reps statutory rights  so they have time to protect workers from discrimination.,503,503

"Use public spending power to drive up standards, including only awarding public contracts to companies which recognise trade unions.",701,505
Introduce a civil enforcement system to ensure compliance with gender pay auditing  so that all workers have fair access to employment and promotion opportunities and are treated fairly at work.,503,506
A Labour government will ensure Britain abides by the global Labour standards of the ILO conventions.,701,507
All workers should be able to work in a safe environment and return to their families at the end of the day.,701,508
Labour will enforce regulations that save lives.,701,509
"As well as legislating against zero hours contracts, there are many more workers on short hours contracts (some only guaranteed a few hours per week), but who regularly work far more.",701,510
"We will strengthen the law so that those who work regular hours for more than 12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract, reflecting those hours.",701,511
"We will also scrap the changes brought in by the Conservatives in 2014 to TUPE, which weakened the protections for workers transferring between contractors,",701,512
and we will abolish the loophole to the agency workers regulations known as the Swedish derogation.,701,513
"We will consult with employers and trade unions on legislating for statutory bereavement leave, for time off work after the loss of close family members.",701,514
"We will also consult on toughening the law against assaulting workers who have to enforce laws such as age-related sales or ticketing arrangements, and who face regular abuse.",605.1,515
"Labour will maintain the ACAS Early Conciliation System to try to solve workplace issues efficiently,",701,516
and we will protect the current compromise on Sunday trading hours.,701,517
Labour will also legislate to permit secure online and workplace balloting for industrial action votes and^internal union elections.,701,518
"Workers in Britain are among the easiest and cheapest to make redundant, meaning when multinational companies are taking decisions to downsize that British workers are at a disadvantage.",701,519
We will consult with trade unions and industry on reviewing redundancy arrangements to bring workers in Britain more into line with their European counterparts.,701,520
Stagnating incomes have forced many to take on more debt.,701,521
Labour will introduce a version of Scotlands Debt Arrangement Scheme to give breathing space to households struggling with high debts.,701,522
"Self-employment can bring many benefits, freedoms and flexibilities to people  and is a vital and often entrepreneurial sector of our economy.",402,524
But there is also mounting evidence that workers are being forced into self-employment by unscrupulous employers to avoid costs and their duties to workers.,701,525
"Labour will clamp down on bogus self-employment by: · Shifting the burden of proof, so that the law assumes a worker is an employee unless the employer can prove otherwise.",701,526
"Imposing punitive fines on employers not meeting their responsibilities, helping to deter others from doing the same.",701,527
"Involving trade unions in enforcement, e.g. by giving them a seat on the executive board of the new Ministry of Labour.",701,528
Giving the Ministry of Labour the resources to enforce all workers rights.,701,529
"Banning payroll companies, sometimes known as umbrella companies, which create a false structure to limit employers tax liabilities and limit workers rights.",701,530
Giving employment agencies and end-users joint responsibility for ensuring that the rights of agency workers are enforced.,701,531
"Rolling out sectoral collective bargaining and strengthening trade union rights, because empowering people to claim their own rights in the workplace is the most effective means of enforcement.",701,532
"We would also extend the rights of employees to all workers, including shared parental pay, making a substantial and immediate difference to the quality of life of people in insecure work.",701,533
But there are real concerns that rapid changes to the world of work are rendering existing employment categories outdated.,701,534
"Labour recognises that the law often struggles to keep up with the ever-changing new forms of employment and work, so we will set up a dedicated commission to modernise the law around employment status.",701,535
New statutory definitions of employment status would reduce the need for litigation and improve compliance.,701,536
The commission will be led by legal and academic experts with representation from industry and trade unions.,701,537
"After seven years of rising poverty and inequality, Labour will rebuild and transform our social security system.",504,539
"Like the NHS, our social security system is there for all of us in our time of need, providing security and dignity in retirement and the basics in life should we become sick or disabled, or fall on hard times.",504,540
Labour will always be on the side of pensioners and help ensure security and dignity for older people in retirement.,504,542
"As the Conservatives abandon their commitments to older people, Labour will guarantee the state pension triple lock throughout the next Parliament.",504,543
"It will rise by at least 2.5 per cent a year or be increased to keep pace with inflation or earnings, whichever is higher.",504,544
The Winter Fuel Allowance and free bus passes will also be guaranteed as universal benefits.,504,545
We will protect the pensions of UK citizens living overseas in the EU or further afield.,504,546
Over 2.5 million women born in the 1950s have had their state pension age changed without fair notification.,504,547
These women deserve both recognition for the injustice they have suffered and some kind of compensation for their losses.,504,548
"Alongside our commitment to extend Pension Credit to hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable women, Labour is exploring options for further transitional protections, to ensure that all these women have security and dignity in older age.",504,549
This must never happen again.,504,550
"Labour will legislate so that accrued rights to the basic state pension cannot be changed, but future benefits can.",504,551
The pension age is due to rise to 66 by the end of 2020.,504,552
Labour rejects the Conservatives proposal to increase the state pension age even further.,504,553
"We will commission a new review of the pension age, specifically tasked with developing a flexible retirement policy to reflect both the contributions made by people, the wide variations in life expectancy, and the arduous conditions of some work.",504,554
Well restore confidence in the workplace pension system and put people rather than profit at its centre.,504,555
"Labour will end rip-off hidden fees and charges,",403,556
"and enable the development of large efficient pensions funds, which will mean more cash for scheme members",504,557
and lower costs for employers.,402,558
"A Labour government will commit to an immediate review of the mineworkers pension scheme and British Coal superannuation scheme surplus, sharing arrangements between government and scheme beneficiaries.",504,559
Poverty in Britain is rising due to the Conservatives attempts to balance the books on the backs of the poorest.,504,561
"They have slashed social security over the last seven years, leaving more people in poverty, subject to a punitive sanctions regime, and reliant on food banks.",504,562
Labour will act immediately to end the worst excesses of the Conservative governments changes.,504,563
We will: · Scrap the punitive sanctions regime,504,564
Scrap the Bedroom Tax,504,565
Reinstate Housing Benefit for under-21s,504,566
Scrap cuts to Bereavement Support Payment.,504,567
"The cuts to work allowances in Universal Credit (UC), and the decision to limit tax credit and UC payments to the first two children in a family, are an attack on low-income families and will increase child poverty.",504,568
"Labour will reform and redesign UC, ending six-week delays in payment and the rape clause.",504,569
"With nearly four million children currently living in poverty, the majority in working families, we will commit to tackle child poverty with a new Child Poverty Strategy.",504,570
The Tories have completely failed on their promise of making work pay,504,571
and on tackling the barriers to work faced by people with disabilities.,503,572
Labour supports a social model of disability.,503,573
People may have a condition or an impairment but they are disabled by society.,503,574
We need to remove the barriers in society that restrict opportunities and choices for people with disabilities.,503,575
"We will build on the previous Labour governments commitment to people with disabilities in 2009 as signatories to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and incorporate it into UK law.",705,576
Labour will repeal the following cuts in social security support to people with disabilities through a new Social Security Bill published in ourfirstyear in office.,504,577
"We will: · Increase Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) by £30 per week for those in the work-related activity group,",504,578
and repeal cuts in the UC limited capacity for work element.,504,579
Increase Carers Allowance by £11 to the level of Jobseekers Allowance.,504,580
Implement the court decision on Personal Independence Payment (PIP) so that there is real parity of esteem between those with physical and mental-health conditions.,504,581
"Scrap the Work Capability and Personal Independence Payment assessments and replace them with a personalised, holistic assessment process that provides each individual with a tailored plan, building on their strengths and addressing barriers.",504,582
Labour will end the privatisation of assessments.,504,583
End the pointless stress of reassessments for people with severe long-term conditions.,504,584
Commission a report into expanding the Access to Work programme.,504,585
"We will change the culture of the social security system, from one that demonises people not in work to one that is supportive and enabling.",504,586
"As well as scrapping the Conservatives punitive sanctions regime, we will change how job centre Plus staff are performance-managed.",504,587
"Labour will strengthen access to justice for people with disabilities by enhancing the 2010 Equality Act, enabling discrimination at work to be challenged.",503,588
"We will ensure that under the Istanbul Convention, disability hate crime and violence against women with disabilities is reported annually, with national actions plans to address these issues.",605.1,589
Home is at the heart of all of our lives.,603,591
"Its the foundation on which we raise our families, the bedrock for our dreams and aspirations.",603,592
"But for too many people, the housing pressures they face are getting worse not better.",504,593
Britain has a housing crisis  a crisis of supply and a crisis of affordability.,504,594
"After seven years of failure, the Conservatives have no plan to fix the housing crisis.",504,595
"Since 2010, housebuilding has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s,",408,596
"rough sleeping has risen every year,",504,597
"rents have risen faster than incomes,",701,598
"there are almost 200,000 fewer home-owners,",408,599
and new affordable housebuilding is at a 24-year low.,504,600
It doesnt have to be like this.,504,601
Labour will invest to build over a million new homes.,504,602
"By the end of the next Parliament we will be building at least 100,000 council and housing association homes a year for genuinely affordable rent or sale.",504,603
"Labour will establish a new Department for Housing to focus on tackling the crisis and to ensure housing is about homes for the many, not investment opportunities for the few.",503,604
"Labours new housing ministry will be tasked with improving the number, standards and affordability of homes.",504,605

We will start work on a new generation of New Towns to build the homes we need and avoid urban sprawl.,504,609

"Labour will not only build more, we will build better.",504,612
"We will insulate more homes to help people manage the cost of energy bills,",504,613
"to reduce preventable winter deaths,",504,614
and to meet our climate change targets.,501,615
We will consult on new rules on minimum space standards to prevent 'rabbit hutch properties,403,616
and on new modern standards for building'zero carbon homes.,501,617
"We will ensure that local plans address the need for older peoples housing, ensuring that choice and downsizing options are readily available.",706,618
"We will keep the Land Registry in public hands, where it belongs,",413,619
and make ownership of land more transparent.,201.1,620
"The number of home-owning households has fallen by 900,000 for the under-45s since 2010.",408,622
Labour will back first-time buyers to buy that special first home.,504,623
"The number of affordable homes to buy has plummeted by two-thirds under the Conservatives, so we will build thousands more low-cost homes reserved for first-time buyers.",504,624
We will guarantee Help to Buy funding until 2027 to give long-term certainty to both first-time buyers,403,625
and the housebuilding industry.,402,626
We will also give local people buying their first home'first dibs on new homes built in their area to give them confidence that new homes will be available to them and their families.,503,627
"After seven years of failure under the Conservatives, Labour will build the new homes first-time buyers need -",504,628
"just as Labour councils have been doing right across the country, building an average of nearly 1,000 more new homes than Conservative councils.",411,629
"We will back those who own their homes, including home-owners who own their home as leaseholders and who are currently unprotected from rises in'ground rent from developers or management companies.",403,630
A Labour government will give leaseholders securityfrom rip-offground rents and end the routine use of leasehold houses in new developments.,403,631
"We will reverse the cruel decision to abolish housing benefit for 18 to 21- year-olds, which risks putting even more vulnerable young people on our streets.",504,632
"We will end insecurity for private renters by introducing controls on rent rises, more secure tenancies, landlord licensing and new consumer rights for renters.",403,634
"Soaring rents are a real problem - leading to more families living in temporary accommodation, more people sleeping rough, and many not having enough money to save up for a deposit or for a rainy day.",504,635
"Labour will make new three-year tenancies the norm, with an inflation cap on rent rises.",403,636
Given the particular pressures in London we will look at giving the Mayor the power to give renters in London additional security.,301,637
We will legislate to ban letting agency fees for tenants.,403,638
We will also empower tenants to call time on bad landlords by giving renters new consumer rights.,403,639
Renters are spending £9.6 billion a year on homes that the government classes as'non-decent.,403,640
Around a quarter of this is paid by housing benefit.,403,641
A Labour government would introduce new legal minimum standards to ensure properties are'fit for human habitation and empower tenants to take action if their rented homes are sub-standard.,403,642
"Under the Conservatives, affordable housebuilding has fallen to a 24-year low.",504,644

"The lessons of the past, including those from the Chilcot Inquiry, show why our response to these challenges must be different.",105,1279

"Labour will therefore implement the Arms Trade Treaty to a consistently high standard, including ceasing arms exports to countries where there is concern that they will be used to violate international humanitarian law (IHL).",201.2,1321

We have a duty to properly reward and remunerate our Armed Forces.,104,1347

"social justice,",503,1367
womens rights,503,1368
and poverty reduction.,107,1369

and protect the environment.,501,1372

"This is a failure of diplomacy,",106,1376
conflict resolution,106,1377
"and of human rights, which is why they will be at the heart of Labours foreign policy.",201.2,1378
The Conservatives have completely failed to show any leadership on this issue.,305.1,1379
"In the first 100 days of government, we will produce a cross-departmental strategy to meet our international obligations on the refugee crisis.",201.2,1380
The current global tax system is deeply unjust.,503,1381

"Balanced, sustained prosperity can assist in changing the lives of so many people who currently feel left behind by society,",410,10
by the political process,202,11
and by the economy.,503,12
It is the reason the SDLP is highlighting the need for a new Prosperity Process.,410,13
The SDLP has for many years supported the devolution of corporation tax powers.,301,14
"However, corporation tax on its own will not bring the growth we need.",410,15
We must seek access to all the tools we need to repair our economy.,410,16
If we are to attract high quality jobs through inward investment then we need to ensure we have a suitably qualified skills pool to take up these opportunities.,411,17
We also need to address urgently infrastructure imbalances to ensure that economic growth is not centred exclusively on Belfast but is regionally balanced.,411,18
"We recognise the new challenges that increased fiscal powers will bring, not least the potential variance of the Northern Ireland block grant, but we believe our abilities are more than enough for this challenge.",301,19
The SDLP believe this major step can set the local economy on a new trajectory.,301,20
Only full control of our finances will allow us to have full control of our future.,301,21
The Northern Ireland economy is unbalanced and our private sector is underdeveloped.,410,22
"We need the private sector and its contribution to the economy, more of the same poor economic governance will only hold us back.",410,23
"The SDLP will establish, in partnership with the British government, a Scottish style commission to begin the devolution of further powers which will allow us to take control of additional fiscal levers.",301,24
Through this mechanism Scotland has succeeded in winning the argument to allow them to borrow money and issue their own bonds.,301,25
The same powers should be extended to Northern Ireland to enable us to stimulate our private sector through infrastructure projects.,301,26
To tackle unemployment we must strengthen policies which allow people to get to work.,701,27
We need to attract and create not only more jobs,701,28
but higherpaying jobs in Northern Ireland.,701,29

Recent reports have shown that 50% of families living in poverty in Northern Ireland have at least one family member working.,701,49
It is clear that work is no longer a guaranteed route out of poverty.,701,50
The SDLP believe that Northern Ireland needs more higher paying jobs.,701,51
The Living Wage is one way of ensuring work is a route out of poverty.,412,52
SDLP led the way in making Belfast City Council the first Living Wage Council in Ireland.,412,53
The SDLP has campaigned for the proper regulation of Zero Hour Contracts and for Northern Ireland to lead the way by introducing legal protections for those on ZeroHour contracts.,701,54

Northern Irelands needs in agriculture and fishing are often better represented bythe Irish government during European negotiations on fish quotas.,703,68

"Tourism in the North is worth over £720 million to the local economy, and is responsible for 43,000 jobs.",410,82
It can go much further as a driver of investment and employment.,410,83
The SDLP recognise the enormous potential of tourism to stimulate Northern Irelands economy,410,84
and to create much needed jobs.,701,85
Reduce the rate of Northern Irelands VAT rate to 5% in the tourism and hospitality sectors.,402,86
This reduction could see the number of jobs within hotels grow by 40% by 2020.,701,87
Develop the River Bann and the Fermanagh Lakelands as a major growth element in water and recreation tourism.,410,88
This would stimulate hospitality and open up towns along our waterways.,410,89

Support local government in developing effective tourism strategies including taking advantage of the tourism potential of our built heritage.,410,92
Education is an investment in our childrens future.,506,93
Education is also key to achieving both social justice and longterm prosperity.,503,94

"Currently the percentage of people in Northern Ireland reporting that they have no qualifications is 18.3%, nearly double the UK average of 9.9%.",506,96

Children in Northern Ireland should have the opportunity to be taught computer programming from the age of 8.,506,99
Seven years and £16 million were wasted on the now defunct Education and Skills Authority Bill because of the DUP and Sinn Féins inability to agree.,506,100
The SDLP fought hard to ensure that the Education Authority will now be truly representative of our unique educational landscape.,506,101
Irish medium education and the voluntary grammar and integrated sectors are now all represented at board level.,506,102
The SDLP voted against the massive increase in the tuition fees cap which will restrict access to education for young people.,506,103

"In 2010, Liberal Democrats insisted the coalition adopt a fairer approach to dealing with the deficit, using both spending cuts and tax rises, than the Conservatives had planned.",503,105

"Our second fiscal rule is that over the economic cycle we will balance the overall budget, no longer borrowing to pay for everyday expenditure.",414,139
We will make one significant exception to enable us to invest in the things that will help our economy grow.,410,140
"Provided the debt rule is met, the government will be able to borrow for capital spending that enhances economic growth or financial stability, enabling us to increase this productive investment.",410,141
"In our Spending Review we will set out long-term plans for capital expenditure,",410,142
"and ensure that investment in infrastructure, including in housing and energy efficiency,",411,143

increases in childcare support through the benefit system,504,467

"While sanctions can be a necessary last resort to ensure jobseekers are looking for work, they should not be used to cut benefit expenditure deliberately.",504,489

and we must continue to do so as we balance the books.,414,503
"However, we do not support proposals for a lengthy freeze to working age benefits,",503,504
and we will not protect benefits for the wealthiest pensioners at the expense of people working on low wages.,503,505
"Our priority is to tackle the causes of rising benefit bills  high rents, low pay, sickness and unemployment.",503,506
"We will: Introduce a 1% cap on the uprating of working-age benefits until the budget is balanced in 2017/18,",505,507

We will retain the free bus pass for all pensioners.,504,521
"Britains employment laws are among the best in the world,",701,523
balancing the needs of business for flexibility,402,524
with the rights of staff to fair treatment.,701,525
"Nonetheless there are still too many examples of low pay, exploitation, and bad practice, which contribute to unacceptable levels of inequality in our society.",503,526
"This has to change: the more people earn a decent wage, the fewer will be dependent on benefits or stuck in poverty.",701,527
"We will: Encourage employers to provide more flexible working,",701,528
expanding Shared Parental Leave with an additional use it or lose it month to encourage fathers to take time off with young children.,503,529
"While changes to parental leave should be introduced slowly to give business time to adjust, our ambition is to see Paternity and Shared Parental Leave become a day one right.",503,530
Ensure swift implementation of the new rules requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish details of the different pay levels of men and women in their organisation.,701,531

We will improve enforcement action and clamp down on abuses by employers seeking to avoid paying the minimum wage by reviewing practices such as unpaid internships.,412,537
Establish an independent review to consult on how to set a fair Living Wage across all sectors.,412,538

and encourage other public sector employers to do likewise.,412,540
"Improve the enforcement of employment rights, reviewing Employment Tribunal fees to ensure they are not a barrier.",412,541
We will ensure employers cannot avoid giving their staff rights or paying the minimum wage by wrongly classifying them as workers or self-employed.,412,542
Liberal Democrats understand that flexible employment contracts  including Zero Hours contracts  can work well for employees and businesses.,701,543
But that is not always the case and we will continue to stamp out abuse.,701,544
We will create a formal right to request a fixed contract,701,545
and consult on introducing a right to make regular patterns of work contractual after a period of time.,701,546
"For too long, sickness benefits were used as a way of parking people away from the unemployment statistics.",503,548
"Our aim is to get everyone the support and help they need, both financially and in terms of advice and support.",503,549
That does require a formal assessment: but these tests have to be fair and should not be an extra burden for vulnerable people.,503,550
That is why we have made many improvements to the assessments introduced by the last government.,503,551
"We want to aim even higher, ensuring assessments are truly fair, with quick access to financial help for those who cannot work, and support for those who can.",503,552

and those whose homes are substantially adapted do not have their Housing Benefit reduced.,503,561

until we have balanced the books in 2017/18,414,836

We made a start towards this £1 billion increase in the Budget by securing a £250m a year investment in mental health.,504,838
Increasing NHS spending in line with economic growth from then on.,504,839
These commitments mean NHS funding in England will be at least £8 billion higher a year in real terms by 2020.,504,840
"This will lead to higher funding for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, too, which Liberal Democrats believe should be spent on their health services.",504,841

That is why we will increase mental health spending in Englands NHS by £500m a year by 2016/17  half of which we delivered in this years Budget ,504,854
"and provide the cash for similar investments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",504,855
"To deliver genuine equality between mental and physical health in the NHS we will: Continue to roll out access and waiting time standards for children, young people and adults.",504,856

"Support community services and volunteers working to combat loneliness, particularly in later life.",504,885
"We need services that fit around peoples lives, not ones that force them to fit their lives around the care they need.",504,887
This is going to be increasingly important as our population ages and the number of people living with long-term conditions continues to grow.,504,888
"It is time to move away from a fragmented system to an integrated service with more joined-up care,",504,889
and more personal budgets so people can design services for their own individual needs.,504,890
"We believe this should happen from the bottom up, suiting the needs of local communities.",504,891
"We will: Secure local agreement on full pooling of budgets between the NHS and care services with a target date of 2018, consulting on a legal duty for this.",504,892

"We will end the role of the Competition and Markets Authority in health, making it clear that the needs of patients, fairness and access always come ahead of competition,",406,904
and that good local NHS services do not have to be put out to tender.,406,905
"After determined negotiations, we now have a clear guarantee from the EU that member states rights to provide public services directly and not open them up to competition are explicitly enshrined in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP),",406,906

"The UK secures many benefits from immigration, which boosts our economy and helps staff our public services, especially our NHS.",607,1618

We still believe these are essential changes and will continue our work to deliver them.,202,1639
"For freedom to be meaningful, people need the power not just to make decisions about their own lives, but about the way their country, their community, their workplace and more are run.",202,1640

and work for a shared future in Northern Ireland,301,1662
"Meet the needs of England with Devolution on Demand, letting local areas take control of the services that matter most to them",301,1663
"Unfair votes, overcentralisation of decision-making, the power of patronage and the influence of powerful corporate lobbies mean ordinary citizens and local communities are too often excluded and sidelined in politics today.",202,1665
We need to reform British politics to make it more representative and more empowering of our citizens so it commands greater public confidence.,202,1666
"We will: Take big money out of politics by capping donations to political parties at £10,000 per person each year,",202,1667

"Liberal Democrat Ministers were the ones to lead the 2012 Scotland Act and the 2014 Wales Act through Parliament, transferring more financial autonomy to Scotland than ever before",301,1692
and Wales first tax powers.,301,1693
"And in the last months, we have given the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the power to lower the voting age to 16.",301,1694
Now we need go further.,301,1695

"In short, we will deliver Home Rule to each of the nations of a strong, federal United Kingdom.",204,1697
Constitutional change has taken place rapidly.,204,1698

"Control a range of benefits for older people, carers and disabled people.",301,1703
"After the independence referendum, the Smith Commission brought Scotlands five main parties together to agree what further powers should be assigned to the Scottish Parliament.",301,1705
Liberal Democrats ensured the package of powers reflects Scotlands key priorities.,301,1706
The Scottish Parliament should raise in tax more than half of what it spends in its budget.,301,1707
"A Scottish welfare system should allow the Scottish Parliament to change the benefits regime where there is specific Scottish need or priority, with a starting budget of around £3 billion.",301,1708
These powers and more will deliver for the Scottish people: an empowered and accountable Scottish Parliament,202,1709
in a strong and secure United Kingdom.,202,1710
We will deliver Home Rule for Scotland by implementing the Smith Commission proposals in full in the first session of the next Parliament.,204,1711

"We endorse the recent St. Davids Day announcement and will implement it in full, devolving powers over energy, ports, local elections, broadcasting and more, and implementing a reserved powers model.",301,1714

with a view to devolving long-haul APD.,301,1718

"Liberal Democrats wish to see a permanently peaceful, stable, non-sectarian",106,1728
and truly democratic society in Northern Ireland.,202,1729
We will work constructively with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish Government to ensure the political stability of the Northern Ireland Assembly and other institutions of the Belfast Agreement.,202,1730
"To grow the economy, tackle social exclusion, overcome inequality and deliver efficiencies in public services, Liberal Democrats will support policies and initiatives that promote sharing over separation and counter the cost of division.",202,1731
A key aspect of this is dealing with the legacy of the past.,106,1732
"The Stormont House Agreement represents another stage in the intensive work necessary to build long-term peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland.",106,1733
In Government we delivered on the commitment to enable the devolution of Corporation Tax to Northern Ireland by April 2017.,301,1734
We will continue to work with all parties to implement the full package of measures in the Stormont House Agreement and address outstanding issues.,301,1735
We will build on this by: Keeping under review the prospect of further devolution of fiscal powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly,301,1736
and other powers that would improve the financial accountability of the Assembly.,202,1737
Promoting a strong mechanism for working constructively with civic society in Northern Ireland.,606,1738
"Working to ensure the interface is smooth and effective between national security and counter-terrorism policing on the one hand, and local policing and criminal justice activities on the other.",202,1739
"Supporting changes to the powers and internal mechanisms of the Northern Ireland Assembly that reinforce the development of normal, democratic principles",202,1740
and enhances the creation of a shared future beyond sectarianism and division.,106,1741
Working with the political parties in Northern Ireland to tackle the cost of division and ensuring all Government policies in Northern Ireland support the aim of a genuine Shared Future for all.,202,1742
"Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has implications for the UK Parliament and its dual role in legislating for England as well as the federal UK.",204,1744
"It is possible that a future UK government could use the support of MPs representing Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland to secure the passage of legislation that only affects England, even if the majority in England were opposed.",204,1745
This would be a key issue for our proposed Constitutional Convention to address.,204,1746
"Liberal Democrats believe an English-only stage in legislation affecting England should be considered, so English MPs can have a separate say on laws that only affect England.",204,1747
"However, this would need to be on a proportional basis, genuinely reflecting the balance of opinion in England, not the distorted picture generated by the First Past the Post system.",202,1748
"Beyond Parliament, there is much to change to improve the way communities in England are governed.",301,1749
"By returning power to the villages, towns, cities and regions of England we can drive growth, improve public services and give people freedom to run their own lives.",301,1750

"Establish a Government process to deliver greater devolution of financial responsibility to English Local Authorities, and any new devolved bodies in England, building on the work of the Independent Commission on Local Government Finance.",301,1754
Any changes must balance the objectives of more local autonomy and fair equalisation between communities.,202,1755
"In some areas of England there is an even greater appetite for powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same speed and there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach.",301,1756
"We will therefore introduce Devolution on Demand, enabling even greater devolution of powers from Westminster to Councils or groups of Councils working together  for example to a Cornish Assembly.",301,1757
The nations of the United Kingdom have long had different needs with regard to funding.,301,1759
The Barnett Formula is the mechanism used to adjust spending allocations across the UK.,301,1760
The Liberal Democrats have already delivered a substantial extension of financial powers to the nations of the UK and we will devolve further fiscal powers to the devolved governments.,301,1761
"In order to ensure reliable funding, we will retain the Barnett Formula as the basis for future spending allocations for Scotland and Northern Ireland.",301,1762
This will protect the individual nations budgets from external shocks like the recent global drop in the price of oil.,301,1763
We recognise the findings of the Holtham Commission that the current formula underfunds Wales and will commission work to update this analysis.,301,1764
"We will address the imbalance by immediately entrenching a Barnett floor set at a level that reflects the need for Wales to be funded fairly,",301,1765
and seek over a Parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level.,301,1766
"To lead a fulfilled life, people need power over more than just their government.",202,1768
"Liberal Democrats will spread democracy in everyday life by encouraging mutuals, cooperatives, and employee participation and by increasing the opportunities for people to take democratic control over the services on which they rely.",202,1769

"We will: Aim to increase the number of Neighbourhood, Community and Parish Councils and promote tenant management in social housing.",202,1771
"Encourage employers to promote employee participation and employee ownership, aiming to increase further the proportion of GDP in employee-owned businesses.",405,1772
We will change company law to permit a German-style two-tier board structure to include employees.,405,1773
"Introduce mandatory arbitration for strikes likely to cause widespread public disruption, enabling us to defend workers rights to strike while ensuring continued service in essential public services.",405,1774
"Strengthen worker participation in decision-making, including staff representation on remuneration committees, and the right for employees who collectively own 5% of a company to be represented on the board.",202,1775

"We recognise the importance of a plural and diverse media, free from state influence or from monopolistic or dominant market control, in guaranteeing a vibrant national conversation.",201,1783
We will therefore reform the existing arrangements for safeguarding plurality in the media broadly in line with the recommendations of the 2014 Lords Communications Select Committee report.,201,1784
"We will: Give lead responsibility to Ofcom and enable it to conduct reviews periodically, as well as when triggered by proposed mergers and acquisitions,",201,1785
and enable Ofcom to set down conditions to prevent the reach of any media company damaging the public interest.,201,1786
Ensure any conditions or requirements that Ofcom lays down following a plurality review can only be vetoed or interfered with by a Minister after a vote of both Houses of Parliament.,202,1787

"Health and wellbeing are affected by far more than just the quality of health and social care services, so we will work to improve the wider factors that affect peoples health such as warm homes, clean air and access to exercise and healthy food so that everyone can have the best chance to lead a healthy life.",503,78
Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Saving the NHS by putting a penny in the pound on Income Tax to give the NHS and social care services the cash injection they need.,504,79
Transforming mental health care with waiting time standards to match those in physical health care.,504,80

People are routinely left stranded in hospital after they finish their treatment because the follow-up care and support they need is not available.,504,88

Any party seeking to lead the country after this election should be prepared to take bold action to safeguard them.,504,92
"This isnt about doing the easiest thing, it is about doing what is right and what is essential.",504,93
Liberal Democrats will take five key steps to put our health and social care system back on a sustainable financial footing:,504,94
"1 . An immediate 1 p rise on the basic, higher and additional rates of Income Tax to raise £6 billion additional revenue, which would be ringfenced to be spent only on N HS and social care services.",504,95
"Direct this additional investment to the following priority areas in the health and care system: social care, primary care (and other out-of-hospital care), mental health and public health.",504,96
This represents the most efficient and effective way of spending these extra resources  ensuring they will have the greatest impact on the quality of care patients receive.,504,97
"In the longer term and as a replacement for the 1 p Income Tax rise, commission the development of a dedicated health and care tax on the basis of wide consultation, possibly based on a reform of National Insurance contributions, which will bring together spending on both services into a collective budget and set out transparently, on peoples payslips, what we spend on them.",504,98
"Establish a cross-party health and social care convention, bringing together stakeholders from all political parties, patients groups, the public and professionals from within the health and social care system to carry out a comprehensive review of the longer-term sustainability of the health and social care finances and workforce, and the practicalities of greater integration.",504,99
We would invite the devolved administrations to be a part of this work.,301,100
"Introduce a statutory independent budget monitoring agency for health and care, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility.",504,101
"This would report every three years on how much money the system needs to deliver safe and sustainable treatment and care, and how much is needed to meet the costs of projected increases in demand and any new initiatives  to ensure any changes in services are properly costed and affordable.",504,102
Our longer-term objective will be to bring together NHS and social care into one seamless service  pooling budgets in every area by 2020 and developing integrated care organisations.,504,103
"Our health and social care services greatest resource is their staff, working tirelessly under immense pressure.",504,105
This Government has left them feeling embattled and undervalued.,305.1,106
To support the N HS and social care workforce we will: Guarantee the rights of all N HS and social care service staff who are EU nationals to stay in the UK.,701,107
End the public sector pay freeze for NHS workers.,701,108
Reinstate student nurse bursaries.,504,109
"Support innovation in how organisations can empower staff and patients, including learning from innovative social enterprises delivering community and mental health services.",504,110
Protect N HS whistle-blowers.,201.2,111
"GPs in particular have been put under considerable strain due to severe underfunding and neglect from the Conservatives, leaving many people waiting weeks to get appointments.",504,112
GPs are the core of what the NHS is and they need su pport to ensure that the N HS is able to su rvive and thrive.,504,113
"Produce a national workforce strategy, ensuring that we never again experience a shortage in the numbers of GPs, hospital doctors, nurses and other professionals that the N HS needs.",504,115
"In government, we fought tirelessly to reduce the historic inequality between the way physical and mental health are treated in the NHS and are proud of the strides forward we made.",504,117
We legislated to give mental and physical health equality under the law.,504,118
We introduced the first waiting time standards for access to treatment for mental health.,504,119
We introduced the crisis care concordat which dramatically reduced the number of people who end up in police cells when they experience a mental health crisis;,504,120
and we secured more money for children and young peoples mental health services.,504,121
But we know that not enough resources reach front-line services and that in the fight for parity of esteem there is still a very long way to go.,504,122
"Ringfence funding from within the one penny Income Tax rise, to provide additional investment in mental health.",504,124
"Continue to roll out access and waiting time standards for children, young people and adults.",504,125
This will include a guarantee that people will not wait more than six weeks for therapy for depression or anxiety,504,126
and no young person will wait more than two weeks for treatment when they experience a first episode of psychosis.,504,127
Increase access to clinically- and cost-effective talking therapies so that hundreds of thousands more people can receive this support.,504,128
"Examine the case for introducing a dedicated service for children and Young people based on the Australian headspace model and building on many excellent youth information, advice and counselling services.",504,129

"Ensure that no one in crisis is turned away, with new waiting time standards and better crisis care in accident and emergency departments, in the community and via phone lines.",504,132

"End out-of-area placements, ensuring those admitted to hospital for mental ill-health are able to be treated close to home.",504,134
"Ensure that all front-line public service professionals, including in schools and universities, receive better training in mental health.",504,135

Ensure that LGBT+ inclusive mental health services receive funding and support.,504,139
Medical research is vital for developing new and better treatments.,411,140
We will fight the threat Brexit poses to medical research funding.,411,141
We support the principle that all medical trials using public facilities or resources should comply with the Open Trials standards,202.1,142
and that a fair proportion of all public funding for medical research should be focused on research into mental ill-health.,504,143
We also favour the further development of open access academic journals.,506,144
"We need services that fit around peoples lives, not ones that force them to fit their lives around the care they need.",504,146
This will become increasingly important as our population ages and the number of people living with long-term conditions grows.,504,147
It is also more cost-effective to support people to be able to live at home rather than endure lengthy stays in hospital.,504,148
We must move away from a fragmented system to an integrated service with more joined-up care and more personal budgets so that people can design services for their own individual needs.,504,149
"We believe this should happen from the bottom up, suiting the needs of local communities.",606.2,150
"The number of family carers is rising, including in the sandwich generation who find themselves trying to care for their children and their parents at the same time.",504,151

and are suitable to practice by introducing a statutory code of conduct backed up by a care workers suitability register.,504,157
"Raise the amount people can earn before losing Carers Allowance from £1 10 to £1 50 a week,",504,158
and reduce the number of hours care per week required to qualify.,504,159
"Give the NHS a legal duty to identify carers and develop a Carers Passport scheme to inform carers of their NHS rights, such as flexible visiting hours and access to support.",504,160
"Provide more choice at the end of life and move towards free end-of-life social care, whether people spend their last days at home or in a hospice.",504,161
Evaluate the valuable work of hospices with a view to putting them on a more sustainable financial footing and allowing them to expand their services.,504,162
Most peoples experience of the NHS is their local GP or the nurses and support staff who visit them at home or work in community clinics.,504,164
"Access to care in GP surgeries and closer to home is better for patients and will also help reduce pressure on hospitals, accident and emergency departments and ambulances.",504,165
"We will: Promote easier access to GPs, expanding evening and weekend opening to meet the needs of local patients, encouraging online, phone and Skype appointments, encouraging GPs to work together in federations and allowing people more choice.",504,166
"Provide national support to struggling GP practices, preventing mass practice closures.",504,167
Support GPs to come together to collectively provide services such as out-of-norma l-open i ng-hours appointments.,504,168
"Use innovation funding to promote GP-led multidisciplinary health and care hubs, including mobile services to keep people out of hospital.",504,169
Encourage GPs and other community clinicians to work in disadvantaged areas through our Patient Premium  which would give incentive payments to clinicians.,504,170
Ensure that any changes to the way pharmacies are funded do not leave local areas without reasonable access to a community pharmacist.,504,171
Review the rules for exemption from prescription charges to ensure they are fair to those with long-term conditions and disabilities.,504,172
"It is better for patients and for the NHS if we keep people healthy in the first place, rather than just waiting until people develop illnesses and come for treatment, but 40% of NHS spending is on diseases that are preventable.",504,174
"We need to do more to promote healthy eating and exercise, making people aware of the dangers of smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs, and helping to improve mental health and wellbeing.",504,175
We will: Move towards a health and social care system that empowers and encourages people to better manage their own health and conditions and to live healthier lives.,504,176

Introduce mandatory targets on sugar reduction for food and drink producers.,403,186
"Reduce smoking rates, introducing a levy on tobacco companies so they fairly contribute to the costs of health care and smoking cessation services.",504,187

Support good practice among employers in promoting wellbeing,504,192
"and ensure people with mental health problems get the help they need to stay in or find work,",504,193
with a wellbeing premium to reward employers who take clear action to measurably improve the health of their employees.,504,194
"We will develop a just settlement for haemophiliacs who were given contaminated blood, and for their families.",504,195
Liberal Democrats have always put education at the heart of our agenda.,506,197

"it fosters understanding and tolerance,",202.1,199
and it empowers our children,706,200

"to ensure a productive, competitive economy",410,204

Too many people have their chances in life determined by who their parents are rather than by their own efforts and abilities.,503,206
"With our Pupil Premium, investing in children who might otherwise fall behind, we are finally beginning to tackle the scandalous gap in attainment between rich and poor.",503,207
"But now the Conservatives want to take us back 50 years, to an outdated system of grammar schools and secondary moderns, ignoring all the research and expert advice that show it will damage the life chances of so many children.",503,208
"Liberal Democrats recognise the dual role of education in giving young people the knowledge and skills they need to be part of a productive, competitive economy, and helping them grow into happy, healthy and engaged members of their community.",506,209
Childrens education is too often distorted by schools need to focus on the next set of league tables and the next inspection.,506,210
Teachers deserve to be treated as professionals and given the flexibility and support to apply their expertise.,506,211
"Schools should be free to encourage children to participate in a truly rounded curriculum including the arts, sport and culture that broaden childrens learning and develop their passion for education.",506,212

"Schools in England are facing an unprecedented funding crisis, with rising pupil numbers and an inadequate financial settlement meaning that real-terms per-pupil funding is being squeezed.",506,220
At the same time the Conservatives flawed approach to the National Fair Funding Formula means some schools will lose out even more.,506,221

Raise the quality of early years provision and aim for every formal early years setting to employ at least one person who holds an early years teacher qualification by 2022.,506,231
Too many good teachers are leaving the profession  in many cases because of the excessive pressure they are under from heavy workloads and funding cuts.,506,233
We want to empower teachers and make sure they feel valued for the essential work they do.,506,234
"We want to improve the status of the teaching profession, and support and nurture teachers in their work  helping to drive up standards in every school.",506,235

Far too many children are still failing to get the opportunities they need.,503,245
We cannot fail our children  especially when we know it is the children who need the most help who are the most likely to be let down.,503,246
The Conservatives obsession with more grammar schools is not the answer.,506,247
Liberal Democrats want to give every child the chance of attending an excellent local school.,503,248

"Education should equip children with rich knowledge for life, nurturing creativity and problem-solving, and instilling a passion for lifelong learning.",506,261
"Children should be helped to develop the life skills they will need as adults, and every pupil should be given advice and guidance about their future.",506,262
"We will: Introduce a curriculum entitlement  a slimmed down core national curriculum, which will be taught in all state-funded schools.",506,263
"This will include Personal, Social and Health Education: a curriculum for life including financial literacy, first aid and emergency lifesaving skills, mental health education, citizenship and age-appropriate Sex and Relationship Education (SRE).",506,264

Englands young people are some of the unhappiest and most anxious in the world.,706,280
Schools are on the front line in dealing with children and young adults with mental health issues.,506,281

The ability of universities to attract funding to maintain top-quality research activity and deliver the best teaching depends on being open and outward looking.,506,293
The ability to attract and retain the best staff and students in our world-class universities is vital.,506,294
Brexit undermines these at every turn.,108,295
"In government, Liberal Democrats established a fairer system such that no undergraduate student in England had to pay a penny of their tuition fees up front or pay anything afterwards until they earn more than £21,000 per year.",506,296
"This meant that only high-earning graduates would pay their tuition fees in full, and eliminated systematic discrimination against part-time students.",503,297
"We now have the highest university application rates ever, including from disadvantaged students.",506,298
"But the Conservatives are threatening to undermine opportunity by ending student bursaries, freezing the repayment threshold and raising the level of fees.",503,299
"We will: Reinstate maintenance grants for the poorest students, ensuring that living costs are not a barrier to disadvantaged young people studying at university.",503,300
"Establish a review of higher education finance in the next parliament to consider any necessary reforms, in the light of the latest evidence of the impact of the existing financing system on access, participation and quality, and make sure there is no more retrospective raising of rates, or selling-off of loans to private companies.",506,301

"We want it to become the norm for businesses to take on and train up young people as apprentices in every sector of our economy, and for higher-level apprenticeships to be understood as a respected alternative to university education.",411,310
As our economy rapidly changes the need for people to retrain and reskill has never been more important.,411,311
It is no longer the case that the skills learned at 18 or 21 will last throughout a career.,411,312
The ability to learn new skills or change careers is also vital in creating the opportunity for people to succeed no matter their stage in life.,503,313
Thats why Liberal Democrats support the need for lifelong learning.,506,314
"We will: Aim to double the number of businesses which hire apprentices, including by extending apprenticeships to new sectors of our economy such as creative and digital industries.",411,315
"Develop national colleges as national centres of expertise for key sectors, such as renewable energy, to deliver the high-level vocational skills that businesses need.",411,316
"Work with the Apprenticeship Advisory Group to increase the number of apprentices from BAME backgrounds,",503,317
ensure gender balance across industry sectors,503,318
and encourage under-represented groups to apply.,503,319
"Identify and seek to solve skills gaps  for example the lack of advanced technicians  by expanding higher vocational training such as foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas, Higher National Certificates and Higher Apprenticeships.",411,320
"Ensure that all the receipts from the Apprenticeship Levy in England are spent on training, aiming to fund a wider range of types of training.",411,321
"Aim to meet all basic skills needs including literacy, numeracy and digital skills by 2030.",411,322
"Create individual accounts for funding mature adult and part-time learning and training,",411,323
"and provide for all adults individual access to all necessary career information, advice and guidance.",411,324
Facilitate across the U K an effective and comprehensive system for credit transfer and recognition of prior learning and qualifications.,411,325
Britains economy is unbalanced.,503,327
"There are stark contrasts between regions,",503,328
"between old and young,",503,329
and between the successful and those left behind.,503,330
New technologies are beginning to transform the economy.,411,331
"Machine learning, artificial intelligence and automation are affecting the type and the scale of employment.",411,332
"New global markets are opening up for low-carbon and resource-efficient goods, services and infrastructure.",411,333
The scope and speed of these changes will be profound and rapid.,411,334
Britain needs a sustainable and balanced economy not just to help fund public services,416.2,335
but because growth and enterprise create jobs and opportunities for all.,503,336
Liberal Democrats believe that there is much to be done to create an economy that ensures that the whole population benefits from the technological advances ahead.,503,337
We will work to support growth now and put in place a sustainable economy that will create growth for the future,416.2,338
 an economy that works for the long term:,416.2,339
"prosperous,",410,340
"green,",416.2,341
open,401,342
and fair.,403,343
The actions of the Conservatives have undermined the Coalitions work in fixing the economy.,305.1,344
They have chosen to risk the long-term future of our economy by limiting vital spending on infrastructure,411,345
and creating an over-reliance on consumer spending fuelled by debt to prop up growth.,414,346
They have consistently put their own short-term ambition above long-term economic prosperity.,305.1,347
"Above all, their disastrous determination to pursue a hard Brexit casts a shadow over our economic future.",108,348
"As a result, our economy is at its most fragile since the 2008 crash.",305.1,349
"We need a radical programme of investment to boost growth,",410,350
develop new infrastructure fit for the future,411,351
and get our economy back on track.,414,352
Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Boosting the economy with a major programme of capital investment aimed at stimulating growth across all areas of the UK.,410,353
"Eliminating the deficit on day-to-day spending by 2020 to control the national debt, and then borrowing only to invest.",414,354
"Ensuring strong public services by investing the proceeds of a 1 p rise in Income Tax in the NHS and social care,",504,355
and commiting to protecting the schools budget in real terms.,506,356
"Liberal Democrats reject the Conservative Governments damaging and irrational commitment to run budget surpluses on both capital and revenue,",414,358
which imposes completely unnecessary deep cuts in spending,414,359
and limits the scope for much-needed capital investment.,402,360
But we have no intention of just throwing away our hard-fought efforts to control the deficit during the Coalition years.,414,361
Liberal Democrats will therefore commit to eliminating the deficit in day-to-day spending by 2020.,414,362
"This means we will be able to keep debt as a share of national wealth falling through the parliament, unless there is a recession.",414,363
Once we have brought current expenditure into balance we will ensure that overall public spending grows roughly in line with the economy.,414,364
This means that we can improve key public services and provide them with the investment they need.,504,365
A long-term stable economy requires more than just discipline over spending.,411,366
"It requires us to invest in people, innovation and infrastructure in order to give our economy the opportunity to remain competitive for the future.",411,367
The Conservatives have failed to take advantage of historically low interest rates to borrow for the investment that would create jobs now,701,368
and prepare us and our economy for the future.,411,369
Liberal Democrats will therefore commit to a responsible and realistic £1 00 billion package of additional infrastructure investment.,411,370
"This will prioritise: New direct spending on housebuilding to help build 300,000 homes a year by 2022.",411,371
"A programme of installing hyperfast, fibre-optic broadband across the U K.",411,372
Capital investment in schools and hospitals to support capacity increases and modernisation.,411,373
"Significant investment in road and rail infrastructure, including a continued commitment to HS2, Crossrail 2 and rail electrification.",411,374
Additional funding to bring more private investment into renewable energy.,411,375
"£5 billion of initial capital for a new British Housing and Infrastructure Development Bank, using public money to attract private investment for these priorities.",411,376
We will ensure that the National Infrastructure Commission takes fully into account the environmental implications of all national infrastructure decisions.,501,377
We will also devolve significant infrastructure spending to local areas.,301,378
"Our investment in new infrastructure is matched by our commitment to protecting vital public services, including the NHS",504,379
and education.,506,380
We will make the difficult decisions needed to ensure our NHS is protected for the long term,504,381
and that children are given the opportunities they need to succeed.,503,382
"We will therefore commit to: Increase spending on the N HS and social care, using the proceeds of a 1 p rise in Income Tax.",504,383
"This will be paid by taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the revenue will be ringfenced for spending on NHS and social care services in England, with the appropriate share also being transferred to Wales and Northern Ireland.",504,384
This taxation will be neither levied nor spent in Scotland.,301,385
There will be a commensurate 1 p increase in dividend taxation which is a U K-wide tax.,504,386
"The receipts of this will be similarly earmarked, with Scotland also receiving its share.",504,387
Protect the education budget in real terms per pupil from early years to age 19.,506,388
"End the 1 % cap on pay rises in the public sector,",504,389
and uprate wages in line with inflation.,412,390
The Conservative pursuit of hard Brexit will have serious impacts on the UKs national finances  impacts which current government plans may not fully take into account.,108,391
"Liberal Democrats would choose to pursue a very different European policy, and therefore would expect a better financial situation.",108,392
"We will initiate a spending review after the general election focusing on delivering efficiency,",303,393
"funding proven spend-to-save initiatives,",303,394
"pursuing local and community integration to drive efficiency,",301,395
and investing in technology to get public services and front-line staff online.,303,396
Traditional indicators of economic activity such as GDP are poor guides to genuine prosperity and wellbeing.,504,397
"We will therefore introduce a National Wellbeing Strategy covering all aspects of government policy, including health, housing and the environment.",504,398
In order to balance the books and build a sustainable economy for the future we must ensure that everyone pays their fair share.,503,400
"Liberal Democrats have a long-standing commitment to fairer taxation, and in government we raised the personal allowance for Income Tax.",503,401
It remains our ambition to make taxes fairer,503,402
"and simpler,",303,403
"to help those on low and middle incomes,",701,404
"and to ensure that those on the highest incomes, and large international companies, make a fair contribution.",503,405
"We will: Aim in the long term, and as resources allow, to raise the employee national insurance threshold to the Income Tax threshold,",504,406
while protecting low earners ability to accrue pension and benefit entitlements.,504,407
Ensure those with the highest incomes and wealth are making a fair contribution.,503,408
"We have identified a series of distortions, loopholes and excessive reliefs that should be removed.",503,409
"These include reforms to Capital Gains Tax and dividend tax relief, and refocusing entrepreneurs relief.",408,410
"We would reverse a number of the Conservatives unfair and unjustified tax cuts, including: The cutting of Corporation Tax from 20% to 17%.",503,411
Capital Gains Tax cuts.,403,412
Capital Gains Tax extended relief.,403,413
The Marriage Allowance.,604,414
The raising of the Inheritance Tax threshold.,503,415
"Take tough action against corporate tax evasion and avoidance,",605.1,416
"including by: Introducing a General Anti-Avoidance Rule,",605.1,417
"setting a target for HM Revenue and Customs to reduce the tax gap,",605.1,418
and continuing to invest in staff to enable them to meet it.,605.1,419
Reforming Corporation Tax to develop a system that benefits the smallest companies while ensuring the biggest multinationals cannot avoid paying sums comparable to nationally based competitors.,402,420
"We will consult on shifting away from a profits-based tax to one that takes account of a wider range of economic activity indicators, such as sales and turnover.",403,421
"Reviewing the Business Rates system, prioritising reforms that recognise the development of the digital economy,",402,422
"lessening the burden on smaller businesses,",402,423
and ensuring high streets remain competitive.,401,424
We will also consider the implementation of Land Value Taxation.,503,425
Conduct a full-scale review into the burden of taxation and spending between generations to ensure that government policy promotes fairness between generations.,503,426
"As well as the need for public infrastructure investment, the role of entrepreneurs and small businesses in delivering a thriving economy is fundamental.",402,428
"Liberal Democrats believe there is a vital need for access to finance for new businesses, and those wishing to scale up.",402,429
Creating true competition means allowing new businesses to rise and challenge established companies.,402,430
There are also many well-established small businesses and traders which form the backbone of local economies.,402,431
"Our priority in supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses is to ensure that they have access to the funding they need, and in particular long-term (and patient) capital.",402,432
"We will: Expand the activities of the state-owned British Business Bank, enabling it to perform a more central role in the economy by tackling the shortage of equity capital for growing firms and providing long-term capital for medium-sized businesses.",402,433
Create a new start-up allowance to help those starting a new business with their living costs in the crucial first weeks of their business.,402,434
"Support fast-growing businesses seeking to scale up, through the provision of mentoring support.",402,435
"Review Business Rates to reduce burdens on small firms, and make them the priority for any future business tax cuts.",402,436
"Reform the Regulatory Policy Committee to remove unnecessary regulation,",401,437
"reduce regulatory uncertainty,",403,438
"and support new markets and investment, particularly in low-carbon and resource-efficient innovation.",416.2,439
"In the knowledge-based economy of the future, scientific research, innovation and skills will be crucial to prosperity.",411,441
The advent of robotics and increasing artificial intelligence will also change the nature of work for many people.,411,442
The government needs to act now to ensure this technological march can benefit everyone and that no areas are left in technologys wake.,411,443
"We will: Protect the science budget, including the recent £2 billion increase, by continuing to raise it at least in line with inflation.",411,444
Our long-term goal is to double innovation and research spending across the economy.,411,445
We would guarantee to underwrite funding for British partners in EU-funded projects such as Horizon 2020 who would suffer from cancellation of income on Brexit.,411,446
"Build on the Coalitions industrial strategy, working with sectors which are critical to Britains ability to trade internationally,",411,447

Invest in the future  supporting innovative technologies including the space industry.,411,460
Most businesses recognise the long-term value in treating their employers decently and developing their skills.,701,462
"However, there are still too many examples of unscrupulous employers who perpetuate bad practice, which not only exploits workers",701,463
but can also undermine the competitive position of good employers.,403,464
This has to change if we are to give everyone a decent chance of earning a living,503,465
and move towards a more productive economy.,410,466
"Encourage the creation and widespread adoption of a good employer kitemark covering areas such as paying a living wage, avoiding unpaid internships and using name-blind recruitment to make it easier for customers and investors to exercise choice and influence.",701,468
Establish an independent review to consult on how to set a genuine living wage across all sectors,412,469
". We will pay this living wage in all central government departments and their agencies, and encourage other public-sector employers to do likewise.",701,470
Extend transparency requirements on larger employers to include publishing the number of people paid less than the living wage,701,471
and the ratio between top and median pay.,503,472
"Modernise employment rights to make them fit for the age of the gig economy, looking to build on the forthcoming Taylor report.",701,473
Stamp out abuse of zero-hours contracts.,701,474

"Strengthen enforcement of employment rights, including by bringing together relevant enforcement agencies and scrapping employment tribunal fees.",701,476
Too many people justifiably feel left behind.,503,478
"Liberal Democrats believe that it is vital that everyone is given a stake in our economy,",503,479
that we can only be united and competitive as a country if the rewards are reaped by all.,503,480
A well-functioning economy which works for everyone cannot be based solely on companies owned by and operated on behalf of small groups of shareholders.,503,481
"It should seek to foster a diversity of types of business, including encouraging alternative models such as mutuals, social enterprises or community-interest companies.",402,482
"In all cases, it is vital to ensure the engagement and involvement of employees; successful businesses work for all stakeholders.",405,483

"To tackle the problem of financial exclusion Liberal Democrats will: Take forward the recommendations of the House of Lords Select Committee on Financial Exclusion, in particular by expanding the Financial Conduct Authoritys remit to include a statutory duty to promote financial inclusion as one of its key objectives.",503,495
Prosperity is very unevenly spread across the nations and regions of the UK.,503,497
"The prospect of Brexit, including the loss of £8.9 billion of European Structural and Investment Funds, is only likely to make the problems faced by disadvantaged areas worse.",108,498
Local autonomy with real financial muscle is the only sustainable answer to the regional divide.,301,499
We will: Continue to champion the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine initiatives and invest significant capital resources in infrastructure projects across the north of England and the Midlands.,411,500

"Countries across the globe had recognised that rising temperatures and pollution were not just an environmental issue, but an economic and security issue.",501,511
"But with the election of Donald Trump in the US and Britains vote to leave the EU, the tides of isolationism and populism could halt or even reverse the progress that has been made.",501,512
"The Conservatives seem determined to take Britain back to the 1 980s, when the UK was the dirty man of Europe.",501,513
"They have cut support for renewable energy and home insulation,",501,514
sold off the Green Investment Bank,501,515
and failed to control air pollution.,501,516
Their actions put not just Britains environment at risk,501,517
but the health of its citizens,504,518
"and its economy,",410,519
undermining the increasingly successful green industries which already employ more than half a million workers.,416.2,520

Scotland benefits from being inside the UK and EU single markets.,407,1161
Each is worth billions of pounds and supports tens of thousands of Scottish jobs.,407,1162
Under the Liberal Democrats inclusion in those single markets will continue.,407,1163
Keeping the UK in the EU will remove the basis for the SNPs divisive proposed referendum on independence.,108,1164
"We welcome the new Wales Act, which is intended to implement the St Davids Day agreement secured by Liberal Democrats in government  but it does not go far enough.",301,1166
"Liberal Democrats will deliver proper home rule for Wales and a Welsh Parliament by implementing the remaining Silk part 1 proposals on financial powers and the Silk part 2 proposals to devolve powers over transport, youth justice, policing and other justice powers.",301,1167
"We will raise the status of the National Assembly to become a Welsh Parliament, strengthening its capacity to scrutinise legislation and to hold the Welsh Government to account.",301,1168
We will drastically reduce the number of reserved subjects and prevent Westminster from being able to override Wales on devolved matters.,301,1169
We will recognise Wales as a distinct legal jurisdiction.,301,1170
"Among other powers which we would devolve are funding of Network Rail in relation to the Wales network, allowing the Welsh Government to set its own bank holidays and giving the Childrens Commissioner for Wales the power to examine issues that affect children in Wales but are not within the control of the Welsh Government.",301,1171
To help create jobs,701,1172
"and boost growth in Wales we will abolish the economically distorting tolls on the Severn Bridge, after the costs have been recouped in 2018.",410,1173
"Liberal Democrats wish to see a permanently peaceful,",106,1175
"stable,",305.3,1176
non-sectarian,606.1,1177
and truly democratic society in Northern Ireland.,202.1,1178
We will work constructively with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish government to secure the political stability of the Northern Ireland Assembly and other institutions of the Belfast agreement,305.3,1179
and the implementation of all the recommendations of the report on disbanding paramilitary groups.,106,1180
In particular we are determined to: Maintain the common travel area and freedom of movement.,108,1181
Support local businesses by ensuring participation within the single market and customs union.,407,1182
Ensure that the international human rights protections hard wired into the Good Friday Agreement are not compromised.,201.2,1183
"Protect the rights of Northern Ireland citizens living and working in the EU, and EU citizens living and working in Northern Ireland.",108,1184
Protect the current financial settlement and the funding of programmes supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.,106,1185
"To grow the economy,",410,1186
"tackle social exclusion,",503,1187
overcome inequality,503,1188
"and deliver efficiencies in public services,",504,1189
"Liberal Democrats will support policies and initiatives, such as integrated education, that promote sharing over separation and counter the cost of division.",606.1,1190
"Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has implications for the UK parliament and its dual role in legislating for England as well as the federal UK.",301,1192
"It is possible that a future UK government could use the support of MPs representing Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland to secure the passage of legislation that only affects England, even if the majority in England were opposed.",301,1193
This would be a key issue for our proposed constitutional convention to address.,202.1,1194
"Liberal Democrats support an English-only stage in legislation affecting England, so English MPs can have a separate say on laws that only affect England.",301,1195
"However, this should be on a proportional basis, genuinely reflecting the balance of opinion in England.",202.1,1196
"In some areas of England there is a greater appetite for powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same speed and there cannot be a one-sizefits-all approach.",202.1,1197
All areas should however have access to the same opportunities and mayoral authorities should not be ranked higher in terms of the powers with which they can be granted.,202.1,1198
"We will therefore introduce devolution on demand, enabling even greater devolution of powers from Westminster to councils or groups of councils working together  for example to a Cornish Assembly or a Yorkshire Parliament.",301,1199
The nations of the United Kingdom have long had different needs with regard to funding.,301,1201
The Barnett formula is the mechanism used to adjust spending allocations across the UK.,301,1202
The Liberal Democrats have already delivered a substantial extension of financial powers to the nations of the UK and we will devolve further fiscal powers to the devolved governments.,301,1203
In order to ensure reliable funding we will retain the Barnett formula and the agreed fiscal framework as the basis for future spending allocations for Scotland and Northern Ireland.,301,1204
This will protect the individual nations budgets from external shocks.,301,1205
"We recognise the findings of the Holtham commission that the current formula underfunds Wales, and will commission work to update this analysis.",301,1206
"We will address the imbalance by immediately ensuring that the Barnett floor is set at a level that reflects the need for Wales to be funded fairly, and seek over a parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level.",301,1207
"FOR THE BEST START IN LIFE we will continue to increase spending on the NHS,",504,4
provide 7-day a week access to your GP and deliver a truly 7-day NHS  so you know you will always have access to a free and high quality health service when you need it most.,504,5
"FOR YOUR SCHOOL YEARS we will maintain the amount of money that follows each child into school,",506,6
ensure there is a good primary school place available for every child,506,7
and lift the cap on university places  so you have the skills you need to succeed.,506,8
TO SECURE YOUR FIRST JOB we will create 3 million new apprenticeships;,411,9
"take everyone earning less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether",404,10
and pass a law to ensure we have a Tax-Free Minimum Wage in this country;,412,11
and continue to create a fairer welfare system where benefits are capped to the level that makes work pay  so you are rewarded for working hard and doing the right thing.,505,12
"AS YOU RAISE YOUR FAMILY we will extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants,",403,13
"build 200,000 new Starter Homes  20 per cent below the market price, for first-time buyers under 40 //",403,14
and provide 30 hours of free childcare to working parents of three and four year-olds// ,504,15
so you are able to work while having the security of your own home in which to raise your family.,503,16
"WHILE YOU GROW OLDER we will not raise VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax but we will raise the 40p Income Tax threshold to £50,000",503,17
and take the family home out of tax by increasing the effective Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million  so you can keep more of your income and pass it on to future generations.,503,18
"AND WHEN YOU RETIRE we will continue to increase the Basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent through the triple lock,",504,19
give you the freedom to use your pension savings as you want and pass them on tax-free,504,20
and we will cap the amount you can be charged for your residential care  so you can have the dignity and security you deserve in your old age.,504,21
"Your job, your home, the mortgage you pay, the school your children go to, your local hospital, your pension  all these things depend on a strong economy.",408,26
So we will carry on working through our long-term economic plan.,404,27
We will:keep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts,414,28
"increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500",503,29
"and the 40p Income Tax threshold to £50,000",503,30
"commit to no increases in VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax",503,31
crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do,403,32
"rebalance our economy,",414,33
build a Northern Powerhouse,410,34
and back elected metro mayors,301,35
pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.,404,36
Our long-term economic plan is turning around Britains economy.,404,37
"Five years ago, Britain was reeling from the chaos of Labours Great Recession;",404,38
in 2014 we were the fastest growing of all the major advanced economies,404,39
" last year, we grew 75 per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the Eurozone and seven times faster than France.",404,40
"Five years ago, the budget deficit was more than 10 per cent of GDP, the highest in our peacetime history, and the national debt was rising out of control;",414,41
"today, the deficit is half that level",414,42
and debt as a share of national income will start falling this financial year.,414,43
Industries are coming back to life.,410,45
Companies are striding into new markets.,410,46
Manufacturers are returning to our shores.,410,47
More tech companies are starting up here than anywhere else in Europe.,410,48
We have overtaken France as the third largest car producer in Europe,410,49
"and there are 760,000 more businesses than in 2010 providing jobs and creating wealth across the country.",410,50
"The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival,",410,51
"which is creating on average 1,000 new jobs every day:",701,52
more than the rest of the European Union combined.,410,53
This is no accident.,404,54
It is the product of hard work by people in every part of the country and it is thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan.,404,55
"By halving the deficit, we have helped to restore confidence to the economy.",414,56
"By maintaining fiscal discipline, we have helped keep mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would be.",414,57
"And by establishing the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), we have ended  permanently  the ability of politicians to cook the books for political gain at the nations expense.",304,58
"With inflation at a record low,",404,59
"the latest OBR forecasts show that living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010,",404,60
"and are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade, with the average family £900 better off.",404,61
"It is only by securing the recovery,",414,62
dealing with our debts,414,63
and creating jobs,701,64
that we can continue to raise living standards.,503,65
That means sticking to our long-term economic plan; Britain is on the right path.,404,66
But the job is not finished.,404,67
There are clouds on the international horizon.,404,68
Huge challenges remain at home.,414,69
"We have cut the record deficit we inherited to five per cent of GDP, but that is still too high.",414,70
"Our trade with emerging economies is up, with exports to China more than doubled since 2009,",410,71
but overall we are still too dependent on slow-growing European markets.,410,72
"Business investment is rising, but we still underinvest compared to other countries.",410,73
Productivity remains too low.,410,74
"And while prosperity is now spreading around the country, our economic growth remains uneven, too reliant on financial services.",410,75
We will finish the job we started in a balanced way.,414,77
Those with the broadest shoulders have contributed the most to deficit reduction,414,78
" which is why inequality has fallen,",503,79
and child and pensioner poverty are down  and they will continue to do so.,503,80
We will increase NHS spending every year.,504,81
"We will control spending,",414,82
"eliminate the deficit,",414,83
and start to run a surplus.,414,84
"We will go from stuck in the red, to back in the black.",414,85
"By building on the foundations we have put in place, we will have a truly national recovery and be able to pursue our ambition for Britain to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.",410,86
"If we do not stick to our long-term economic plan, we will slip back again, reversing the progress we have made in the last five years.",404,87
More borrowing  and the extra debt interest that it brings  means there is less money to spend on schools and hospitals.,414,88
"More spending means higher taxes for hardworking people,",414,89
"and interest rates that are higher than they otherwise would be  punishing homeowners, hurting businesses, costing jobs.",414,90
And failing to control our debt would be more than an economic failing; it would be a moral failing  leaving our children and grandchildren with debts that they could never hope to repay.,414,92
So you face a clear choice.,404,93
"Economic competence, with David Cameron as Prime Minister, following through on our long-term economic plan.",404,94
"Or economic chaos under Labour, with higher taxes, more debt and no plan to fix our public finances, create jobs or build a more secure economy.",404,95
We will finish the job by eliminating the deficit to keep our economy secure and keep your taxes and mortgage payments down,414,97
Our long-term economic plan reflects our values:,404,98
we as a nation should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable levels of debt to the next generation.,414,99
We will eliminate the deficit in a sensible and balanced way,414,100
that will enable us to continue to increase spending on the NHS,504,101
and cut Income Tax for 30 million working people.,701,102
Our deficit reduction plan has two phases.,414,103
"The first will see us continue to reduce government spending by one per cent each year in real terms for the first two full financial years of the next Parliament, the same rate as over the last five years.",414,104
That means saving £1 a year in every £100 that government spends.,414,105
"We dont think theres a business that couldnt do that  and we dont think government, when it is spending your money, should be any different.",414,106
"That will require a further £30 billion in fiscal consolidation over the next two years,",414,108
on top of the £120 billion that we have already identified and delivered over this Parliament.,414,109
"We will find £13 billion from departmental savings, the same rate of reduction as in this Parliament.",414,110
"We will find £12 billion from welfare savings,",505,111
on top of the £21 billion of savings delivered in this Parliament.,414,112
"And we will raise at least £5 billion from continuing to tackle tax evasion, and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning,",414,113
building on the £7 billion of annual savings we have delivered in this Parliament.,414,114
"This £30 billion of further consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt keeps falling as a share of GDP and to deliver a balanced structural current budget in 2017-18, meeting the new fiscal mandate that Parliament voted on earlier this year.",414,115
Our commitment goes further than this.,414,116
"A balanced current budget is not enough to deliver a reliable reduction in our level of national debt, which remains far too high in a world of continuing economic challenges.",414,117
International evidence and Treasury analysis shows that the only way to keep our economy secure for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus.,414,118
Anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the past.,414,119
"That is why, in the second phase of our deficit reduction plan starting in 2018-19, we are set to move into surplus, with the Government taking in more than it is spending for the first time in 18 years.",414,120
That means we can start properly paying down our debts and reducing the scale of annual interest payments  reducing the UKs vulnerability to future shocks by fixing the roof while the sun is shining.,414,121
"We will achieve this by continuing to control government spending in 2018-19, no longer cutting it in real terms, but instead growing it in line with inflation.",414,122
"From 2019-20, after a surplus has been achieved, spending will grow in line with GDP.",414,124
"A new fundamental principle of fiscal policy, monitored by the independent OBR, will ensure that in normal economic times, when the economy is growing, the government will always run a surplus in order to reduce our national debt and keep our economy secure,",414,125
with a state neither smaller than we need nor bigger than we can afford.,404,126
"Total government spending as a share of our national income at the end of the next Parliament is forecast to be very slightly higher than in the year 2000, the year before Labour lost all control of spending and the national debt started its longest rise for hundreds of years.",414,127
"Our approach is focused on reducing wasteful spending, making savings in welfare,",505,128
and continuing to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive avoidance.,403,129
"This means that we can commit to no increases in VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance.",404,130
"Tax rises on working people would harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost jobs.",404,131
"Instead, as we reduce the deficit,",414,132
"we will cut Income Tax, as we have done over the last five years:",404,133
"during the next Parliament, we will increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500",404,134
"and the higher rate threshold to £50,000, so you keep more of your hard-earned money.",404,135
"We will continue to build a stronger, safer and more secure banking system that serves its customers and provides businesses with the finance they need to grow",414,137
and create jobs,701,138
We will make sure our financial services industry is the best regulated in the world with our new system of supervision led by the independent Bank of England.,414,139
Our new Financial Policy Committee will monitor and control the growth of indebtedness and imbalances across the whole economy a vital task that was totally ignored in the run up to the financial crisis.,414,140
Our tough new Financial Conduct Authority will protect consumers and ensure that financial markets work for the benefit of the whole economy.,403,141
"To protect hardworking taxpayers from future banking crashes, we will finish the process of ring-fencing banks high street branches from their investment arms by 2019 at the latest.",403,142
"In order to ensure that new pay structures for bankers rebuild trust and reduce short-termism, we will ensure that Britain continues to have the toughest regime of bonus deferral and clawback of any financial centre.",403,143
We will continue to sell the Governments stakes in the bailed-out banks and building societies in order to deliver value for money for taxpayers and support the economy.,401,144
Hardworking taxpayers supported the banks during the financial crisis and so the banks should in turn support them during the recovery  that is why we will keep the bank levy in place and restrict established banks ability to pay less tax by offsetting their profits against past losses.,403,145
Our plan is to ensure banks help secure our recovery and back businesses to create jobs and growth in our economy.,414,147
"We capped payday lenders, made it easier for you to switch your bank account and will continue to support the credit union movement in making financial services more accessible.",403,148
We will continue the successful Funding for Lending scheme into 2016.,403,149
"We will help new and existing challenger banks to inject fresh competition into the market for personal current accounts, mortgages and business loans, including through the British Business Bank,",403,150
while backing the financial technology revolution.,411,151
We will improve our support for investment into start-ups,403,152
"and roll-out our innovative Help to Grow scheme, which will plug a £1 billion finance gap for firms that are looking to expand, invest",403,153
and take on new employees.,701,154
Tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning is an important part of our long-term economic plan.,404,156
"We will increase the annual tax charges paid by those with non-domiciled status,",403,157
"ensuring that they make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and continue to tackle abuses of this status.",414,158
"We will lead international efforts to ensure global companies pay their fair share in tax,",403,159
"as David Cameron did at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013, which secured significant international progress on fairer tax rules and full transparency over who really owns companies.",403,160
We will push for all countries to sign up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;,403,161
review the implementation of the new international country-by-country tax reporting rules and consider the case for making this information publicly available on a multilateral basis.,403,162
We will ensure developing countries have full access to global automatic tax information exchange systems and continue to build the capacity of tax authorities in developing countries.,403,163
"We are also making it a crime if companies fail to put in place measures to stop economic crime, such as tax evasion, in their organisations",605,164
and making sure that the penalties are large enough to punish and deter.,605,165
"We are committed to a truly national recovery, benefiting all parts of our country.",601,168
"We have devolved powers to Scotland and Wales,",301,169
"and set out long-term economic plans to raise the growth rate of all parts of England, bringing areas which have grown more slowly up to at least the national average.",404,170
"Over the last year, the North grew faster than the South.",410,171
"By connecting up the North with modern transport links, we will enable its great cities and towns to pool their strengths.",410,172
We will invest a record £13 billion in transport for the North.,411,173
"We will electrify the main rail routes, build the Northern Hub, and provide new trains for the North.",411,174
"We will upgrade the A1, M62, M1 and A555 link road.",411,175
"And that is on top of our £50 billion commitment to build High Speed 2  the new North-South railway linking up London with the West Midlands, Leeds and Manchester",411,176
 and develop High Speed 3 to join up the North.,411,177
We will back scientific and technical strengths by creating new institutions such as Health North;,411,178
"the Royce Institute for Advanced Materials in Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield;",411,179
the National Centre for Ageing Science and Innovation in Newcastle;,411,180
the Cognitive Computing centre at Daresbury;,411,181
"and by making investments in energy research in Blackpool, Cumbria and Thornton.",411,182
"To help attract growth and new businesses we will improve connections to the South West with major investment in the M5, A358, A30 and A303,",411,184
and the electrification of the Great Western Main Line  bringing new fast trains on the route.,411,185
We will invest to boost tourism in the South West,404,186
and ensure the world-class defence assets and cyber-security industries of the South West benefit the local economy.,404,187
"We will back business by investing a record £5.2 billion in better transport,",411,190
"upgrading the M1 and M6,",411,191
and electrifying the Midland Main Line from St Pancras to Sheffield,411,192
"putting the Midlands at the centre of a modern, inter-connected transport network for the UK.",411,193
"We will back the Midlands strength in advanced manufacturing, engineering and science with major projects such as the Energy Research Accelerator",411,194
and support for innovation in the motor industry.,411,195
"We will improve rail connections to East Anglia, delivering Norwich in 90 minutes and Ipswich in 60 minutes",411,197
and upgrade key roads like the A11 and A47.,411,198
We will support the creation of new jobs,701,199
"by backing the Easts great strengths  agri-tech, high-tech businesses around Cambridge,",411,200
and energy businesses at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft.,411,201
"We will devolve far-reaching powers over economic development, transport and social care to large cities which choose to have elected mayors.",301,204
"We will legislate to deliver the historic deal for Greater Manchester, which will devolve powers and budgets and lead to the creation of a directly elected Mayor for Greater Manchester.",301,205
"In Cambridgeshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire East, we will pilot allowing local councils to retain 100 per cent of growth in business rates, so they reap the benefit of decisions that boost growth locally.",301,206
We will devolve further powers over skills spending and planning to the Mayor of London.,301,207
"And we will deliver more bespoke Growth Deals with local councils, where locally supported,",301,208
and back Local Enterprise Partnerships to promote jobs and growth.,301,209
You depend on infrastructure at every stage of your life:,411,212
"to go to school, to go to work, to enable businesses to grow and create jobs for your children and grandchildren.",411,213
"We have a plan of action that will improve our roads, railways, airports and internet connections. We will:",411,214
invest in infrastructure to attract businesses and good jobs across the whole of the UK,411,215
"make your life easier, with more and faster trains, more roads and cycle routes",411,216
keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament,412,217
"roll out universal broadband and better mobile phone connections, to ensure everyone is part of the digital economy.",411,218
"Under Labour, road and rail were starved of resources,",411,219
while too many people were stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide.,411,220
"This meant packed trains, potholes, patchy broadband coverage  businesses held back and cities left behind.",411,221
Turning these problems around takes time.,411,222
"But because we have made savings elsewhere, we have been able to make significant investments in infrastructure.",411,226
"We will commit, alongside running a surplus, to increase our capital spending  investment in infrastructure  at least in line with our national income.",411,227
We have set out a plan to invest over £100 billion in our infrastructure over the next Parliament.,411,228
"This will fund the biggest investment in rail since Victorian times,",411,229
and the most extensive improvements to our roads since the 1970s.,411,230
And it will give us the most comprehensive and cheapest superfast broadband coverage of any major European country.,411,231
"Overall public investment will be higher on average over this decade, as a percentage of GDP, than under the whole period of the last Labour Government.",411,235
We will deliver on our National Infrastructure Plan and respond to the Airports Commissions final report.,411,236
We will invest £38 billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019.,411,238
"Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme, with work already underway across the North, the Midlands, and South Wales;",411,239
"there are plans to go further in the rest of the country, including East Anglia and the South West.",411,240
"In addition to rolling out our national high-speed rail network, with High Speed 2 and High Speed 3,",411,241
"we will complete the construction of the new east-west Crossrail across Greater London,",411,242
"and push forward with plans for Crossrail 2, a new rail route running through London and connecting Surrey and Hertfordshire.",411,243
We will support a fairer deal for taxpayers and commuters:,403,244
we will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament,412,245
" regulated fares will only be able to rise by Retail Price Inflation, and train operating companies will not have any flexibility to raise ticket prices above this.",412,246
We will also introduce smart ticketing and part-time season tickets and require train companies to improve compensation arrangements for passengers when trains are more than a few minutes late.,403,247
"We are investing millions of pounds in fitting out trains with new wi-fi equipment and improving mobile phone signals, which will benefit passengers on trains across England and Wales.",411,248
"We abolished Labours fuel duty escalator, and instead have frozen fuel duty, delivering the longest duty freeze in 20 years.",412,250
We will invest £15 billion in roads.,411,251
"This will include over £6 billion in the northern road network, with the dualling and widening of the A1 north of Newcastle and the first new trans-Pennine road capacity in over 40 years.",411,252
"We will take action to tackle some of the most notorious and longstanding problems on our road network, including improvements to the A303, A47 and A27.",411,253
"We will add 1,300 extra lane miles to our roads,",411,254
"improve over 60 problem junctions,",411,255
and continue to provide enough funding to fix around 18 million potholes nationwide between 2015 and 2021.,411,256
Our aim is for almost every car and van to be a zero emission vehicle by 2050,501,258
 and we will invest £500 million over the next five years to achieve it.,501,259
We want to double the number of journeys made by bicycle,501,260
"and will invest over £200 million to make cycling safer, so we reduce the number of cyclists and other road users killed or injured on our roads every year.",501,261
"We will secure the delivery of superfast broadband in urban and rural areas to provide coverage to 95 per cent of the UK by the end of 2017,",411,264
and we will ensure no one is left behind by subsidising the cost of installing superfast capable satellite services in the very hardest to reach areas.,411,265
We will also release more spectrum from public sector use to allow greater private sector access.,411,266
And we have set an ambition that ultrafast broadband should be available to nearly all UK premises as soon as practicable.,411,267
We will hold the mobile operators to their new legally binding agreement to ensure that 90 per cent of the UK landmass will have voice and SMS coverage by 2017.,403,269
We will continue to invest in mobile infrastructure to deliver coverage for voice calls and text messages for the final 0.3  0.4 per cent of UK premises that do not currently have it.,411,270
"We will ensure that Britain seizes the chance to be a world leader in the development of 5G, playing a key role in defining industry standards.",601,271
"Whatever stage of life you are at  whether youre looking for your first job out of school, or coming to the end of your career  we will work to help you enjoy the satisfaction and rewards of a decent job.",701,274
"We will: help businesses to create two million new jobs, so we achieve full employment",701,275
give businesses the most competitive taxes of any major economy,402,276
back small firms with a major business rates review,402,277
"support three million new apprenticeships, so young people acquire the skills to succeed",411,278
"If you want to live in the most vibrant and dynamic country in the world, this election matters.",601,279
"Only the Conservatives have the vision, the optimism, the ambition and the discipline to transform Britain.",601,280
Thats because we know that a decent job is the best weapon against poverty and the best way to provide security for families.,701,281
"Thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan, Britain is creating more jobs than the 27 other countries of the European Union put together.",404,283
That means more people with the security of a regular pay packet.,404,284
"Over the past five years, 1.9 million new jobs have been created;",701,285
"1,000 jobs for every single day that we have been in government.",701,286
This represents a transformation in many peoples lives;,701,287
giving families more security;,701,288
boosting the self-esteem of young people taken on;,706,289
and providing hope for those who have been unemployed for years.,701,290
But we need to go further.,404,291
"We have set out the bold aim of achieving full employment, with the highest employment rate of any major economy.",404,292
We want Britain to be the best place in the world to start a business,402,293
and will create another two million jobs over the next Parliament.,701,294
"We will abolish long-term youth unemployment, and make sure that all young people are either earning or learning.",404,295
"And we will make our economy more inclusive, by removing barriers that stop women and disabled people from participating in our workforce.",503,296
"To achieve this, we will back British businesses:",402,298
"cutting red tape,",402,299
"lowering taxes on jobs and enterprise,",402,300
"getting young people into work,",701,301
boosting apprenticeships,411,302
and investing in science and technology.,411,303
"With the Conservatives, Britain will be the best place in Europe to innovate, patent new ideas and set up and expand a business.",402,304
We aim to be number one in Europe,402,305
and in the top five worldwide in the World Banks Doing Business rankings by 2020,402,306
and to lead Europe in attracting foreign investment.,402,307
Backing business also means helping our farmers and our rural communities.,703,308
"Neglected for 13 years under Labour, we have started the process of championing and connecting up the countryside.",703,309
"In the coming years, we will go further, helping our farmers,",703,310
supporting British food around the world,703,311
and opening up new export markets.,703,312
This is all at risk if the Labour Party forms the government.,305,313
"Their policies to spend more, borrow more and tax more would be catastrophic for Britains businesses  and for all the families thrown back into the despair of joblessness and financial uncertainty.",305,314
We have already delivered 2.2 million new apprenticeships over the last five years.,411,318
"Over the next five years, we will deliver three million more and ensure they deliver the skills employers need.",411,319
"We aim to achieve full employment in the UK,",701,320
"with the highest employment rate in the G7,",701,321
and we will help businesses create two million jobs over the Parliament.,701,322
We have abolished the jobs tax  employers' National Insurance contributions (NICs)  for the under 21s,402,323
and next year we will do the same for young apprentices under 25.,402,324
"We will continue to help smaller businesses take on new workers through the Employment Allowance, which frees businesses from the first £2,000 of employers NICs so that a third of employers pay no jobs tax.",402,325
"Our economic plan has helped deliver sharp falls in long-term youth unemployment, taking the numbers of 1618 year-olds not in education, employment or training to historic lows.",404,328
"We will provide support to those 16 17 year olds still not in education, employment or training and to those who risk becoming so.",404,329
Jobcentre Plus advisers will work with schools and colleges to supplement careers advice and provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships.,404,330
"But it is not fair  on taxpayers, or on young people themselves  that 18-21 year-olds with no work experience should slip straight into a life on benefits without first contributing to their community.",505,331
So we will introduce tougher Day One Work Requirements for young people claiming out-of-work benefits.,505,332
"We will replace the Jobseekers Allowance for 18-21 year-olds with a Youth Allowance that will be time-limited to six months, after which young people will have to take an apprenticeship, a traineeship or do daily community work for their benefits.",505,333
It is also not fair that taxpayers should have to pay for 18-21 year-olds on Jobseekers Allowance to claim Housing Benefit in order to leave home.,505,334
So we will ensure that they no longer have an automatic entitlement to Housing Benefit.,505,335
"To support jobs, we cut Corporation Tax from 28 to 20 per cent over the course of the Parliament,",402,337
reduced National Insurance bills,402,338
and capped the rise in business rates.,402,339
"We have extended 100 per cent Small Business Rate Relief and are providing extra support for high street shops by increasing the business rates retail discount to £1,500.",402,340
"In the next Parliament, we want to maintain the most competitive business tax regime in the G20, and oppose Labours plans to increase Corporation Tax.",402,341
"We will conduct a major review into business rates by the end of 2015 to ensure that from 2017 they properly reflect the structure of our modern economy and provide clearer billing, better information sharing and a more efficient appeal system.",402,342
We will also repeal nonsensical restrictions banning employers from hiring agency staff to provide essential cover during strikes;,702,344
and ensure strikes cannot be called on the basis of ballots conducted years before.,702,345
We will tackle intimidation of non-striking workers;,702,346
legislate to ensure trade unions use a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions;,702,347
tighten the rules around taxpayer-funded paid facility time for union representatives;,702,348
and reform the role of the Certification Officer.,702,349
"Strikes should only ever be the result of a clear, positive decision based on a ballot in which at least half the workforce has voted.",702,350
"This turnout threshold will be an important and fair step to rebalance the interests of employers, employees, the public and the rights of trade unions.",702,351
"We will, in addition, tackle the disproportionate impact of strikes in essential public services by introducing a tougher threshold in health, education, fire and transport.",702,352
Industrial action in these essential services would require the support of at least 40 per cent of all those entitled to take part in strike ballots,702,353
 as well as a majority of those who actually turn out to vote.,702,354
This Government was the first in post-war history to reduce the burden of regulation.,402,357
We will cut a further £10 billion of red tape over the next Parliament through our Red Tape Challenge and our One-In-Two-Out rule.,402,358
"This will support our aim to make Britain the best place in Europe, and one of the top five worldwide, to do business by 2020.",402,359
"We will also treble our successful Start Up Loans programme during the next Parliament so that 75,000 entrepreneurs get the chance to borrow money to set up their own business.",402,360
"We will raise the target for SMEs share of central government procurement to one-third,",402,361
strengthen the Prompt Payment Code,402,362
and ensure that all major government suppliers sign up.,402,363
"We have already helped small businesses by increasing the Annual Investment Allowance,",402,364
reducing the burden of employment law through our successful tribunal reforms,402,365
"and supporting 27,000 new business mentors.",402,366
"We will go further by establishing a new Small Business Conciliation service to mediate in disputes, especially over late payment.",402,367
The creation of the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) in 2010 has resulted in many improvements to the UK tax system.,402,369
We will establish the OTS on a permanent basis and expand its role and capacity.,402,370
"We will boost our support for first-time exporters and back the GREAT campaign, so we achieve our goal of having 100,000 more UK companies exporting in 2020 than in 2010 and reach our target of £1 trillion in exports.",402,371
"And we will set a new, significantly higher, permanent level for the Annual Investment Allowance.",402,372
"Last year alone, 140,000 disabled people found work.",503,374
"But the jobless rate for this group remains too high and, as part of our objective to achieve full employment, we will aim to halve the disability employment gap:",503,375
"we will transform policy, practice and public attitudes, so that hundreds of thousands more disabled people who can and want to be in work find employment.",503,376
"We now have more women-led businesses than ever before,",503,377
more women in work than ever before,503,378
and more women on FTSE 100 boards than ever before.,503,379
"We want to see full, genuine gender equality.",503,380
"The gender pay gap is the lowest on record, but we want to reduce it further and will push business to do so:",503,381
we will require companies with more than 250 employees to publish the difference between the average pay of their male and female employees.,503,382
"Under Labour, women accounted for only one in eight FTSE 100 board members.",503,383
They represent a quarter of board members today and we want to see this rise further in the next Parliament.,503,384
"We also want to increase the proportion of public appointments going to women in the next Parliament,",503,385
as well as the number of female MPs.,503,386
"Now that the economy is growing strongly again, we have seen the first real-terms increase in the National Minimum Wage since Labours Great Recession began.",412,389
We strongly support the National Minimum Wage and want to see further real-terms increases in the next Parliament.,412,390
"We accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission that the National Minimum Wage should rise to £6.70 this autumn,",412,391
on course for a Minimum Wage that will be over £8 by the end of the decade.,412,392
We also support the Living Wage and will continue to encourage businesses and other organisations to pay it whenever they can afford it.,701,393
"We will also take further steps to eradicate abuses of workers, such as non-payment of the Minimum Wage,",701,394
exclusivity in zero-hours contracts,701,395
and exploitation of migrant workers.,701,396
"Great science is worthwhile in its own right and yields enormous practical benefits too  curing diseases, driving technological innovation, promoting business investment and informing public policy for the better.",411,398
We ring-fenced the science budget by making difficult choices to reduce spending in other areas.,411,399
Now we will invest new capital on a record scale  £6.9 billion in the UKs research infrastructure up to 2021,411,400
" which will mean new equipment, new laboratories and new research institutes.",411,401
"This long-term commitment includes £2.9 billion for a Grand Challenges Fund, which will allow us to invest in major research facilities of national significance, such as the new Alan Turing Institute, and projects such as the Polar Research Ship and Square Kilometre Array.",411,402
We have boosted research and development tax credits,411,403
"and we will continue to support our network of University Enterprise Zones, ensuring that Britain's world-beating universities are able to make money from the technology they develop.",411,404
"We will support our modern industrial strategies, such as our successful Life Sciences strategy, to help people compete and win in the intense global race for high value, high knowledge jobs.",411,405
We will work with the Automotive Council in support of our resurgent car industry,410,406
and direct further resources towards the Eight Great Technologies  among them robotics and nanotechnology  where Britain is set to be a global leader.,411,407
We have delivered a network of catapult centres  R&D hubs in the technologies of the future,411,408
 and we will create more to ensure that we have a bold and comprehensive offer in place for Britains researchers and innovators.,411,409
"We have the land, the technology, and the entrepreneurial flair to enable us to make the most of the economic potential of our rural areas.",410,412
We will provide rural Britain with near universal superfast broadband by the end of the next Parliament,411,413
"and secure the future of 3,000 rural Post Offices.",411,414
"We know how important it is to preserve vital community assets such as pubs, town halls and sports facilities, so we will strengthen the Community Right to Bid that we created.",606,415
"We will extend the length of time communities have to purchase these assets,",606,416
and require owners to set a clear reserve price for the community to aim for when bidding.,606,417
"We will set up a Pub Loan Fund to enable community groups to obtain small loans to pay for feasibility work, lawyers fees, or materials for refurbishment, where they have bid to run the pub as part of our reforms to the Community Asset Register.",606,418
"We will set out a long-term vision for the future of British farming, working with industry to develop a 25 year plan to grow more, buy more and sell more British food.",703,420
"We will allow farmers to smooth their profits for tax purposes over five years, up from the current two years, to counter income volatility.",703,421
"We will treble the number of apprenticeships in food, farming and agri-tech, as part of our plan to secure three million more apprenticeships.",703,422
We will support a science-led approach on GM crops and pesticides,703,423
and implement our 25-year strategy to eradicate bovine TB.,703,424
"We will liberate farmers from red tape by coordinating all visits through a single Farm Inspection Taskforce, which will involve farmers themselves and use data from existing industry schemes, such as Red Tractor.",703,425
We will push for further reform of the EUs Common Agricultural Policy.,703,426
We will promote British food abroad by setting up a Great British Food Unit to help trademark and promote local foods around the world,703,427
"and back British food at home, by guaranteeing that all central government departments purchase food to British standards of production by the end of the Parliament.",703,428
"We will also help consumers to buy British by pushing for country of origin labelling in Europe, particularly for dairy products, following on from our success with beef, lamb, pork and poultry.",703,429
"And we will champion our new Groceries Code Adjudicator, so farmers receive a fair deal from the supermarkets.",703,430
"We will defend our hard-won Common Fisheries Policy reforms, which include ending the scandalous practice of discarding perfectly edible fish",703,432
"and reforming the quota system so that all at-risk species, including cod, plaice, haddock and seabass, will be fished sustainably by the end of the next Parliament.",703,433
"We will continue to devolve the management of North Sea fisheries to local communities,",703,434
"and rebalance the UKs inland water quotas to smaller, specific locally-based fishing communities.",703,435
"We will protect hunting, shooting and fishing, for all the benefits to individuals,",502,437
the environment,501,438
and the rural economy that these activities bring.,703,439
"A Conservative Government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.",305,440
"Our goal is a country that not only rewards those who work hard and do the right thing, but gives everyone  no matter their background  the chance to fulfil their potential.",503,443
Achieving this means seeing through our major reforms of tax and welfare.,404,444
"cut income tax for 30 million people, taking everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether",404,446
pass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays Income Tax on what they earn,404,447
"back aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold  so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays it",404,448
"cap overall welfare spending,",505,449
"lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive to £23,000",505,450
"and continue to roll out Universal Credit, to make work pay",505,451
"bring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work,",504,452
and give working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.,504,453
"Under Labour, those who worked hard found more and more of their earnings taken away in tax to support a welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged, people to choose benefits when they could be earning a living.",505,454
"This sent out terrible signals: if you did the right thing, you were penalised  and if you did the wrong thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all infuriating hardworking people.",505,455
"Over the last five years, we have cut peoples taxes wherever possible.",404,458
"We have raised the tax-free Personal Allowance to £10,600 from £6,475:",404,459
over 26 million people are now keeping more of their hard-earned money,404,460
and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying no Income Tax at all.,404,461
"We believe that cutting peoples taxes is the right thing to do  not only because it is your money,",404,462
but also because cutting the taxes of the lowest paid and helping them stand on their own two feet is the most effective poverty-tackling measure there is.,404,463
"Real fairness means that where people really cannot work, they must be supported  but where they are able to work, they should.",404,464
We have made long overdue changes to our welfare system.,505,465
We have capped benefits so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits than the average household earns by going out to work.,505,466
We have begun to introduce Universal Credit  a way to simplify benefits into a new single payment  so that work always pays.,505,467
We are reassessing those on incapacity benefits so that help goes to those who really need it.,505,468
The days of something for nothing are over,505,469
" and all this has helped to reduce by 900,000 the number of people living in workless households.",404,470
"In the next Parliament, we will continue to reward hard work:",404,471
raising the tax-free Personal Allowance so that those working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pay no Income Tax at all,404,472
and taking hardworking people out of a 40p higher rate tax band originally meant to capture only the wealthy.,404,473
"And we will see through our welfare reforms, lowering the benefit cap and rolling out Universal Credit, to make the system fairer and reward hard work.",404,474
"A Conservative Government will not increase the rates of VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance in the next Parliament.",404,479
"Instead, we will ease the burden of taxation by raising the tax-free Personal Allowance  the amount you can earn before you start paying tax  to £12,500.",503,480
"This will cut Income Tax for 30 million people and take everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether.",503,481
"That means by the end of the decade, one million more people on the lowest wages will be lifted out of Income Tax,",503,482
and people who work for 30 hours a week on the increased National Minimum Wage will no longer pay any Income Tax at all.,503,483
We will pass a new law so that the Personal Allowance automatically rises in line with the National Minimum Wage.,503,484
The new Tax Free Minimum Wage law will be applied from the first Budget after the General Election.,503,485
"The change will update the 1977 'Rooker-Wise' amendment which forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, meaning the Personal Allowance will now increase more quickly.",503,486
The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the best-off people in our country.,503,489
"But in the past couple of decades, far too many have been dragged into it.",503,490
We have already announced an above-inflation increase in the threshold next year.,404,491
"Now we will raise the 40p tax threshold much further, so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays the higher rate of Income Tax.",404,492
"The 800,000 people earning between £42,385 and £50,000 will no longer pay the 40p rate of tax.",404,493
"We will support you, whether you choose to go out to work or stay at home to raise your children.",603,495
"We will back the institution of marriage in our society, enabling married couples to transfer £1,060 of their tax-free income to their husband or wife, where the highest earner is a basic rate taxpayer.",603,496
"This applies to civil partnerships too, and the transferable amount will always rise at least in line with the Personal Allowance.",603,497
And we will help families stay together and handle the stresses of modern life by continuing to invest at least £7.5 million a year in relationship support.,603,498
"We have already legislated to introduce tax-free childcare in the next Parliament  worth up to £2,000 per child per year  to help parents who want to work.",504,500
We introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three and four-year olds,504,501
and the most deprived two year-olds.,504,502
"And because working families with children under school age face particularly high childcare costs, in the next Parliament we will give families where all parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three and four year-olds.",504,503
"We will keep a check on the growth of welfare spending,",505,505
"enabling us to provide a system that is fair to those who need it, and fair to those who pay for it too.",505,506
Our overall welfare cap will limit the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the five years from 2015-16.,505,507
"We will freeze working age benefits for two years from April 2016,",505,508
with exemptions for disability and pensioner benefits as at present,503,509
"-as well as maternity allowance, statutory maternity pay, statutory paternity pay, statutory adoption pay and statutory sick pay.",505,510
"We will deliver Universal Credit, in order to provide the right incentives for people to work;",505,511
target support at those who need it most;,504,512
reduce fraud and error;,505,513
and streamline administration of the welfare system.,505,514
"We will work to eliminate child poverty and introduce better measures to drive real change in childrens lives, by recognising the root causes of poverty:  entrenched worklessness, family breakdown, problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependency.",503,515
"We will lower the maximum amount that a single household can claim in benefits each year from £26,000 to £23,000, so we reward work.",505,519
We will continue to have exemptions from the cap for those receiving Disability Living Allowance or the Personal Independence Payment.,503,520
We will make sure the hardest to help receive the support they need for a fulfilling life.,503,522
"We will review how best to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable conditions, such as drug or alcohol addiction, or obesity, back into work.",504,523
People who might benefit from treatment should get the medical help they need so they can return to work,504,524
". If they refuse a recommended treatment, we will review whether their benefits should be reduced.",505,525
"We will also provide significant new support for mental health,",504,526
benefiting thousands of people claiming out-of-work benefits or being supported by Fit for Work.,504,527
"Our plan to control immigration will put you, your family and the British people first.",601,530
We will reduce the number of people coming to our country with tough new welfare conditions and robust enforcement.,601,531
"keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands",601,533
"control migration from the European Union, by reforming welfare rules",110,534
clamp down on illegal immigration and abuse of the Minimum Wage,605,535
enhance our border security and strengthen the enforcement of immigration rules,605,536
develop a fund to ease pressure on local areas and public services.,301,537
"Conservatives believe in controlled immigration, not mass immigration.",601,538
"Immigration brings real benefits to Britain  to our economy, our culture and our national life.",607,539
"We will always be a party that is open, outward-looking and welcoming to people from all around the world.",607,540
We also know that immigration must be controlled.,601,541
"When immigration is out of control, it puts pressure on schools, hospitals and transport;",601,542
and it can cause social pressures if communities find it hard to integrate.,608,543
"Between 1997 and 2009, under the last Labour Government, we had the largest influx of people Britain had ever seen.",601,545
"Their open borders policy, combined with their failure to reform welfare, meant that for years over 90 percent of employment growth in this country was accounted for by foreign nationals",601,546
 even though there were 1.4 million people who spent most of the 2000s living on out-of-work benefits.,601,547
"For the past five years, we have been working to turn around the situation we inherited.",601,548
"Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students;",605,549
installed proper exit checks at our borders;,605,550
cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages;,605,551
"made it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, by restricting their access to bank accounts, driving licences and private housing;",605,552
and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop people clogging up our courts with spurious attempts to remain in the country.,605,553
All of this has made a difference.,605,554
Immigration from outside the EU has come down since 2010.,605,555
"We have seen many more people from the EU coming to Britain than originally anticipated, principally because our economy has been growing so much more rapidly and creating more jobs than other EU countries.",110,557
"As a result, our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands.",110,558
That ambition remains the right one.,110,559
"But it is clearly going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to achieve.",110,560
Continuing this vital work will be our priority over the next five years.,110,561
"We will negotiate new rules with the EU, so that people will have to be earning here for a number of years before they can claim benefits, including the tax credits that top up low wages.",110,562
"Instead of something-for-nothing, we will build a system based on the principle of something-for-something.",110,563
We will then put these changes to the British people in a straight in-out referendum on our membership of the European Union by the end of 2017.,110,564
"At the same time, we will continue to strengthen our borders, improve the enforcement of our immigration laws and act to make sure people leave at the end of their visas.",605,565
"Across the spectrum, from the student route to the family and work routes, we will build a system that truly puts you, your family and the British people first.",601,566
Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation.,110,569
"We have already banned housing benefit for EU jobseekers,",110,570
"and restricted other benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance.",110,571
We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years.,110,572
"This will reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower-skilled workers to come to Britain.",110,573
"We will introduce a new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years.",110,574
"If an EU migrants child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid.",110,575
"To reduce the numbers of EU migrants coming to Britain, we will end the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all.",110,576
"And if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leave.",110,577
"We will negotiate with the EU to introduce stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back,",110,580
and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement.,110,581
"We want to toughen requirements for non-EU spouses to join EU citizens, including with an income threshold and English language test.",110,582
"And when new countries are admitted to the EU in future, we will insist that free movement cannot apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing Member States.",110,583
We have already capped the level of skilled economic migration from outside the EU.,406,585
"We will maintain our cap at 20,700 during the next Parliament.",406,586
This will ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the skills we really need in our economy.,406,587
We will reform the student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once their visas expire.,406,588
"Our action will include clamping down on the number of so-called satellite campuses opened in London by universities located elsewhere in the UK, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor system for student visas.",406,589
"And as the introduction of exit checks will allow us to place more responsibility on visa sponsors for migrants who overstay, we will introduce targeted sanctions for those colleges or businesses that fail to ensure that migrants comply with the terms of their visa.",605,590
"We have introduced a deport first, appeal later rule for foreign national offenders.",601,592
"We will now remove even more illegal immigrants by extending this rule to all immigration appeals and judicial reviews, including where a so-called right to family life is involved, apart from asylum claims.",601,593
We will also implement a new removals strategy to take away opportunities for spurious legal challenge and opportunities to abscond.,605,594
We will introduce satellite tracking for every foreign national offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or deportation proceedings.,605,595
And we will implement the requirement for all landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants.,601,596
"We have already re-introduced a proper system of exit checks across the country,",605,598
"passed a Modern Slavery Act that will protect people from exploitation,",605,599
and quadrupled the fines for unscrupulous employers who undercut the Minimum Wage.,605,600
Now we will introduce tougher labour market regulation to tackle illegal working and exploitation.,605,601
"To crack down further on illegal working, we will harness data from multiple agencies, including Exit Checks data, to identify illegal immigrants and businesses that employ illegal workers.",605,602
"And to incentivise tougher action on employers who do not pay the minimum wage, we will allow inspection teams to reinvest more of the money raised by fines levied on employers.",605,603
We are taking unprecedented action to tackle health tourism and will recover up to £500 million from migrants who use the NHS by the middle of the next Parliament.,601,605
"To help communities experiencing high and unexpected volumes of immigration, we will introduce a new Controlling Migration Fund to ease pressures on services and to pay for additional immigration enforcement.",601,606
"To prevent sectors becoming partially or wholly reliant on foreign workers, we will require those regularly utilising the Shortage Occupation List, under which they can bring skilled foreign workers into the UK, to provide long-term plans for training British workers.",601,607
We will promote integration and British values,608,609
Being able to speak English is a fundamental part of integrating into our society.,608,610
We have introduced tough new language tests for migrants and ensured councils reduce spending on translation services.,608,611
"Next, we will legislate to ensure that every public sector worker operating in a customer-facing role must speak fluent English.",608,612
"And to encourage better integration into our society, we will also require those coming to Britain on a family visa with only basic English to become more fluent over time, with new language tests for those seeking a visa extension.",608,613
Your child deserves the best start in life.,503,616
A good education is not a luxury; it should be a right for everyone.,506,617
"We will: ensure a good primary school place for your child, with zero tolerance for failure",506,618
turn every failing and coasting secondary school into an academy and deliver free schools for parents and communities that want them,506,619
"help teachers to make Britain the best country in the world for developing maths, engineering, science and computing skills",601,620
create 3 million new apprenticeships,411,621
"and make sure there is no cap on university places, so we have aspiration for all.",506,622
We know what works in education: great teachers; brilliant leadership; rigour in the curriculum; discipline in the classroom; proper exams.,506,623
"We have been bold in reforming the education system to deliver these things, based upon simple, clear principles and values.",506,624
We believe that parents and teachers should be empowered to run their schools independently.,506,625
"We believe that teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need to attract the best graduates into it.",506,626
And we believe that there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum to secure the best from every pupil.,506,627
We inherited a system where far too many children left school without the qualifications and skills they needed.,506,628
"One in three children was leaving primary school unable to read, write and add up properly.",506,629
The number of pupils studying the core academic subjects at GCSE had halved.,506,630
Our schools had fallen down the global league tables for maths and science.,506,631
And the poorest children were attending the weakest schools.,506,632
Our far-reaching education reforms have changed this.,506,633
"We have brought high standards back to teaching, discipline back to schools, and challenging subjects back onto the curriculum.",506,634
"Today, there are a million more pupils in schools rated by Ofsted as good or outstanding.",506,635
"Over a thousand schools that were ranked inadequate have become Academies, bringing in new leadership to promote discipline, rigour and higher standards.",506,636
There are over 250 new free schools  set up and run by local people  delivering better education for the children who need it most.,506,637
We have boosted the number of apprenticeships to record levels  2.2 million over the last five years,411,638
 and last September more people headed off to university than at any time in history.,506,639
"Too many children, however, are still not receiving the excellent education that they deserve.",506,640
"So we will continue our reforms, so that every child has the best possible start in life.",506,641
We have made exams more rigorous and ended grade inflation.,506,645
There is more to do.,506,646
We will start by introducing tough new standards for literacy and numeracy in primary schools.,506,647
We will expect every 11-year-old to know their times tables off by heart and be able to perform long division and complex multiplication.,506,648
"They should be able to read a book and write a short story with accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar.",506,649
"If children do not reach the required standards in their exams at the end of primary school, they will resit them at the start of secondary school, to make sure no pupil is left behind.",506,650
"We will require secondary school pupils to take GCSEs in English, maths, science, a language and history or geography, with Ofsted unable to award its highest ratings to schools that refuse to teach these core subjects.",506,651
We have more than doubled Labours spending on new school places.,506,653
"But we want to go even further, investing at least £7 billion over the next Parliament to provide good school places.",506,654
"And we will let our best headteachers take control of failing primary schools, by expanding the National Leaders of Education programme.",506,655
"Over 4,000 schools are already benefiting from academy status, giving them more power over discipline and budgets.",506,658
And nearly 800 of the worst-performing primary schools have been taken over by experienced academy sponsors with a proven track record of success.,506,659
This is improving education for our children.,506,660
"So we will continue to expand academies, free schools, studio schools and University Technical Colleges.",506,661
"Over the next Parliament, we will open at least 500 new free schools,",506,662
"resulting in 270,000 new school places.",506,663
And we will introduce new powers to force coasting schools to accept new leadership.,506,664
Any school judged by Ofsted to be requiring improvement will be taken over by the best headteachers  backed by expert sponsors or high-performing neighbouring schools  unless it can demonstrate that it has a plan to improve rapidly.,506,665
"We will continue to allow all good schools to expand, whether they are maintained schools, academies, free schools or grammar schools.",506,666
"Over the last five years, we have protected the schools budget and committed £18 billion for new school buildings, so that children can learn in the best environment possible.",506,668
"Under a future Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into school will be protected.",506,669
"As the number of pupils increases, so will the amount of money in our schools.",506,670
"On current pupil number forecasts, there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in the next Parliament.",506,671
"We will continue to provide the pupil premium, protected at current rates, so that schools receive additional money for those from the poorest backgrounds.",506,672
We will support families by providing free meals to all infants.,504,673
And we will make schools funding fairer.,506,674
"We have already increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for their funding in the next Parliament.",506,675
We will not allow state schools to make a profit.,506,676
We have already given teachers greater disciplinary powers.,506,678
"In the next Parliament, we will expect every teacher to be trained not just in how to tackle serious behaviour issues, but also in how to deal with the low level disruption that stops children from learning properly.",506,679
This generation of teachers is already the best-qualified ever.,506,680
"In future, we will recruit and keep the best teachers by reducing the time they spend on paperwork,",506,681
"introducing bursaries for the most in-demand subjects,",506,682
"paying good teachers more,",506,683
further reducing the burden of Ofsted inspections,506,684
and continuing to encourage the growth of Teach First.,506,685
"We will increase the number of teachers able to teach Mandarin in schools in England, so we can compete in the global race.",506,686
"We want teachers to be regarded in the same way as other highly skilled professionals, so we are supporting the creation of an independent College of Teaching to promote the highest standards of teaching and school leadership.",506,687
"We have increased the time schools will spend on maths, and ensured that children learn to code as soon as they start school.",506,689
Maths is now the most popular A-level subject.,506,690
"We aim to make Britain the best place in the world to study maths, science and engineering, measured by improved performance in the PISA league tables.",601,691
"To help achieve this, we will train an extra 17,500 maths and physics teachers over the next five years.",506,692
We will make sure that all students are pushed to achieve their potential and create more opportunities to stretch the most able.,506,693
"Every child deserves a warm, loving home, and to feel safe online and at school.",503,696
We have made improving support for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities a priority.,503,697

"We have given employers much more control over apprenticeship courses, so they teach skills relevant to the workplace.",411,708
"We will continue to replace lower-level, classroom-based Further Education courses with high-quality apprenticeships that combine training with experience of work and a wage.",411,709

"From September, we will go even further, abolishing the cap on higher education student numbers and removing an arbitrary ceiling on ambition.",506,720

"Despite this progress, our NHS faces major challenges.",504,764
"An ageing population will place more pressure on health and social care, and life-saving but expensive new drugs will push up costs.",504,765
"And for years its been too hard to access the NHS out of hours, even though sudden illness and events which you and your family cannot plan for do not respect normal working hours.",504,766

"But alongside the medias rights comes a clear responsibility, which is why we set up the public, judge-led Leveson Inquiry in response to the phone-hacking scandal, created a new watchdog by Royal Charter and legislated to toughen media libel laws.",201,889
Because the work of the free press is so important we will offer explicit protection for the role of journalists via the British Bill of Rights,201,890
and we will ban the police from accessing journalists phone records to identify whistle-blowers and other sources without prior judicial approval.,201,891
Local newspapers are an important source of information for local communities and a vital part of a healthy democracy.,202,892
"To support them as they adapt to new technology and changing circumstances, we will consult on the introduction of a business rates relief for local newspapers in England.",402,893
"The creative industries have become our fastest-growing economic sector, contributing nearly £77 billion to the UK economy  driven in part by the tax incentives for films, theatre, video games, animation and orchestras we introduced.",402,895
Our support for the film industry has resulted in great British films and encouraged Hollywoods finest to flock to the UK.,402,896
"We will continue these reliefs, with a tax credit for childrens television next year, and expand them when possible.",402,897
"We will protect intellectual property by continuing to require internet service providers to block sites that carry large amounts of illegal content, including their proxies.",403,898
And we will build on progress made under our voluntary anti-piracy projects to warn internet users when they are breaching copyright.,403,899
We will work to ensure that search engines do not link to the worst-offending sites.,403,900
Our tourism industry already supports three million jobs and is one of the nations leading employers and export earners.,410,902
We will set challenging targets for Visit Britain and Visit England to ensure more visitors travel outside the capital.,410,903
We will simplify and speed up visa issuance for tourists.,410,904
"And because tourism is an industry that depends more than most on young people, we will step up efforts to recruit more apprentices into the business.",410,905
We want our sportsmen and women to win even more medals in Rio 2016 than they did in London 2012.,502,907
So we will continue to support elite sports funding as part of our Olympic and Paralympic legacy.,502,908
"We will deliver the Rugby World Cup in 2015,",502,909
"the World Athletics Championship in 2017,",502,910

"and the Cricket World Cup in 2019,",502,912
maximising the opportunities for tourism and jobs.,502,913
"We will support new sports in the UK,",502,914
"in particular through greater links with the US National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, with the ultimate ambition of new franchises being based here.",101,915
"We have already boosted funding for sport in primary schools and over 18,000 schools have registered to take part in our School Games.",502,917
"We will go further, supporting primary school sport with £150 million a year, paid directly to head-teachers, until 2020.",502,918
This will make sure that all primary schoolchildren benefit from a minimum of two hours high-class sport and PE each week.,502,919
"We will improve the quality of Community Sports facilities, working with local authorities, the Football Association and the Premier League to fund investment in artificial football pitches in more than 30 cities across England.",502,920
"We will continue to invest in participation and physical activity, recognising sports vital benefits to health",502,921
and to NHS Englands campaign to prevent diabetes.,502,922
"We will lift the number of women on national sports governing bodies to at least 25 per cent by 2017,",503,923
and seek to increase participation in sport by women and girls.,503,924
"Building the Big Society is about involving the people, neighbourhoods, villages, towns and cities of Britain in the great task of improving our country",606,928
 and giving young people the power and opportunity to play a real part in their community.,606,929
"guarantee your child a place on National Citizen Service, so they can learn new skills and meet young people from different walks of life",606,931
promote equal treatment and equal opportunity for all in a society proud of its tolerance and diversity,606,932
"give those who work for a big company and the public sector a new workplace entitlement to Volunteering Leave for three days a year, on full pay.",606,933
"The Big Society is a vision of a more engaged nation,",606,934
one in which we take more responsibility for ourselves and our neighbours;,606,935
"communities working together, not depending on remote and impersonal bureaucracies.",606,936
"Of course, there are many tasks which require the resources and grip of government.",305,937
"But there are also many areas of national life in which we need more people to step forward, take responsibility and play their part.",606,938
"This is about a national culture change, saying to everyone in Britain: ask what you can do for your community and your country.",601,939
"In the past five years, there has been real progress.",606,941
"Volunteering is now at a ten-year high, with over three million more adults giving their time last year than in the year to March 2010.",606,942
"Charitable donations are on the up, with one million more people giving to good causes than at the end of the last Parliament.",606,943
There are now parents groups and charities running their own free schools.,606,944
There are social enterprises helping people into jobs through the Work Programme.,606,945
"We have launched the worlds first social investment bank,",403,946
introduced more social impact bonds than the rest of the world combined,403,947
and highlighted the great work done in communities with the Big Society Awards and the Prime Ministers Points of Light award.,606,948
"A generation of teenagers has undertaken National Citizen Service (NCS), developing their skills, broadening their horizons and growing in confidence;",606,949
"over the next five years, we will expand NCS  so it becomes a rite of passage for young people in our country.",606,950
"We will give more people the power and support to run a school, start their own social enterprise, and take over their own local parks, landmarks and pubs.",606,951
"We will encourage the 1,400 communities engaged in neighbourhood planning to complete the process and assist others to draw up their own plans.",606,952
"And we will take new steps to encourage volunteering, enabling more people to join the unsung heroes who are the backbone of communities across Britain.",606,953
"Over 130,000 young people have graduated from NCS and we have now guaranteed a place on NCS for every 16 and 17-year-old who wants one.",606,956
"In addition to this, we will increase the number of cadet units in schools, so that more students have the chance to learn skills such as leadership and self-reliance.",606,957
"We have pioneered ways to deliver high-quality public services, including through getting the voluntary sector more involved.",606,959
"For example, our Work Programme has helped harness the talent and energy of charities to help people turn their lives around and find their way back into work.",606,960
We will examine ways to build on this type of innovative approach in the future.,606,961
"We have also pioneered the use of social impact bonds and payment-by-results, and we will look to scale these up in the future, focusing on youth unemployment, mental health and homelessness.",606,962
"We will support the Prince of Wales Step Up To Serve initiative, encouraging young people to serve in their community.",606,964
And we will make volunteering for three days a year a workplace entitlement for people working in large companies and the public sector.,606,965
"People could, for example, volunteer for a local charity or serve as a school governor.",606,966
"We have always believed that churches, faith groups and other voluntary groups play an important and longstanding role in this countrys social fabric,",603,967
"running foodbanks,",603,968
"helping the homeless,",603,969
"and tackling debt and addictions, such as alcoholism and gambling.",603,970
"We have already introduced tougher regulation of gambling, with enhanced player protections and planning controls to prevent the further proliferation of high street betting shops;",603,971
we've capped payday lending and backed financial inclusion;,503,972
and will continue to support action that helps vulnerable people get the assistance they need.,503,973
Our historic introduction of gay marriage has helped drive forward equality,503,976
and strengthened the institution of marriage.,603,977
"But there is still more to do, and we will continue to champion equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender people.",503,978
"We will build on the posthumous pardon of Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing, who committed suicide following his conviction for gross indecency, with a broader measure to lift the blight of outdated convictions of this nature.",503,979
"Thousands of British men still suffer from similar historic charges, even though they would be completely innocent of any crime today.",503,980
Many others are dead and cannot correct this injustice themselves through the legal process we have introduced while in government.,503,981
"So we will introduce a new law that will pardon those people, and right these wrongs.",503,982
The government is the servant of the British people.,202,985
"Every pound spent must be scrutinised, and government run as efficiently and effectively as possible.",303,986
We will: save you money by cutting government waste,303,987
"put more of the essential services you use online, to make them more convenient",303,988
"continue to make government more transparent, so you can hold us to account for how your money is being spent.",202,989
"Government is the servant of the British people, not their master.",202,990
That simple fact was forgotten when Labour was in power.,202,991
"Quangos grew in number, wasteful projects proliferated and the bureaucracy swelled  symptoms of a Government that believed it always knew best.",303,992
Conservatives have brought in a new approach.,303,994
"We are determined to measure success not by how much money is spent, but how much it improves peoples lives.",303,995
Whitehall is now leaner and smaller than at any time since the Second World War.,303,996
We have halved the running costs of the Department for Education.,303,997
We have abolished or merged over 300 quangos.,303,998
We have moved paperwork online.,303,999
"We have shone a bright light on government spending  requiring all central government spending over £25,000 to be published online.",303,1000
We have also ensured that people recieve a transparent breakdown of how their taxes are spent.,303,1001
"In the next five years, we will ensure this efficiency revolution continues.",303,1003
We will also continue to reform our political system:,303,1004
"make votes of more equal value through long overdue boundary reforms,",303,1005
reducing the number of MPs,303,1006
and ensuring the Electoral Commission does more to tackle voting fraud.,304,1007
These measures will help to restore public confidence in British politics.,304,1008
"We have reduced the cost of government, by selling empty buildings, managing big projects better, managing big projects better, shrinking the Civil Service, reforming pensions, moving more services online, and improving contracting.",303,1011
We plan a further £10 billion annual savings by 2017-18,303,1012
and £1520 billion in 2019-20.,303,1013
"To eliminate the deficit, we must continue to cut out wasteful spending",414,1014
We have supported the growth of public service mutuals  organisations that are owned by their staff and deliver public services.,303,1016
"We want more of them, so we will guarantee a right to mutualise within the public sector.",303,1017
This will free up the entrepreneurial spirit of public servants and yield better value for money for taxpayers.,303,1018
Transparency has also been at the heart of our approach to government.,202,1019
"Over the last five years, we have been open about government spending, provided access to taxpayer-funded research, pursued open data and helped establish the Open Government Partnership.",303,1020
We will continue to be the most transparent government in the world.,202,1021
"We addressed public concern about the influence of money on politics, with a law that strengthened rules governing non-party campaigning and established a register of consultant lobbyists.",303,1022
"In the next Parliament, we will legislate to ensure trade unions use a transparent opt-in process for subscriptions to political parties.",702,1023
We will continue to seek agreement on a comprehensive package of party funding reform.,303,1024
We value our outstanding public servants.,303,1026
"Over the last five years, we have made efficiencies in government.",303,1027
"We have ruled out the introduction of regional pay in the public sector, which we do not support and will not introduce.",303,1028
"Britain's impartial, professional and highly capable Civil Service is admired around the world and one of our nation's strengths.",601,1029
We will push ahead with reform of the Civil Service to make it more dynamic and streamlined.,303,1030
"We will make recruitment to the Civil Service more open and actively look for exceptional talent, especially in areas where capabilities are in short supply.",303,1031
We will continue to tackle all the bureaucracy of Whitehall that clogs the arteries of government.,303,1032
We will end taxpayer-funded six-figure payoffs for the best paid public sector workers.,303,1033
We will continue to sell unneeded government property and co-locate services wherever possible.,303,1034
"We have already created 20 high-quality digital services, which include apprenticeships applications and tax self-assessments.",303,1035
"We will save you time, hassle and money by moving more services online,",303,1036
while actively tackling digital exclusion.,303,1037
"We will ensure digital assistance is always available for those who are not online,",303,1038
while rolling out cross-government technology platforms to cut costs and improve productivity  such as GOV.UK.,303,1039
"We have improved the operation of Parliament,",303,1041
"strengthening its ability to hold the Government to account, with reforms such as the election of Select Committee chairs and the creation of the Backbench Business Committee, which enables backbenchers, for the first time, to determine a significant proportion of the House of Commons business.",303,1042
"We have also passed the Fixed Term Parliament Act, an unprecedented transfer of Executive power.",202,1043
"In the next Parliament, we will address the unfairness of the current Parliamentary boundaries,",202,1044
reduce the number of MPs to 600 to cut the cost of politics,303,1045
and make votes of more equal value.,202,1046
We will implement the boundary reforms that Parliament has already approved and make them apply automatically once the Boundary Commission reports in 2018.,202,1047
This will deal with the fact that the current electoral layout over-represents parts of the country where populations have been falling and under-represents parts where populations have been rising.,202,1048
"While we still see a strong case for introducing an elected element into our second chamber, this is not a priority in the next Parliament.",203,1050
We have already allowed for expulsion of members for poor conduct and will ensure the House of Lords continues to work well by addressing issues such as the size of the chamber and the retirement of peers.,203,1051
"Building on our introduction of individual voter registration, we will continue to make our arrangements fair and effective by ensuring the Electoral Commission puts greater priority on tackling fraud and considers insisting on proof of ID to vote.",304,1053
"We will complete the electoral register, by working to include more of the five million Britons who live abroad.",202,1054
"We will introduce votes for life, scrapping the rule that bars British citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years from voting.",202,1055
"We will respect the will of the British people, as expressed in the 2011 referendum, and keep First Past the Post for elections to the House of Commons.",203,1056
"And we will introduce English votes for English laws, answering the longstanding West Lothian Question in our democracy.",204,1057
The chance to own your own home should be available to everyone who works hard.,503,1060
We will: help to keep mortgage rates lower by continuing to work through our long-term  economic plan,404,1061
"build more homes that people can afford, including 200,000 new Starter Homes exclusively for first-time buyers under 40",403,1062
"extend the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme to 2020 to help more people onto and up the housing ladder,",403,1063
and introduce a new Help to Buy ISA to support people saving for a deposit,403,1064
give more people the chance to own their home by extending the Right to Buy to tenants of Housing Associations,403,1065
and create a Brownfield Fund to unlock homes on brownfield land,403,1066
ensure local people have more control over planning and protect the Green Belt,403,1067
Conservatives believe passionately in home ownership.,404,1068
"We understand how good it feels when you have worked long hours, saved money for years, and finally take possession of the keys to your first home.",404,1069
"For years, however, people have been finding it harder and harder to get on the housing ladder.",404,1070
"Under Labour, house-building fell to its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s.",404,1071
Developers were building too few homes,404,1072
and the aftermath of the banking crisis saw young people struggling to raise a deposit,404,1073
These past five years have been about reversing this trend.,404,1076
"We have unblocked the planning system, to help builders start building again.",402,1077
"We have introduced Help to Buy, making it much easier for people to secure a mortgage.",403,1078
"And we have reinvigorated the Right to Buy which Labour had cut back, extending home ownership to a whole new generation of social tenants.",403,1079
"As a result, over 200,000 people have been helped either on or up the housing ladder.",403,1080
Most of those helped have been young first-time buyers spread right across our country.,403,1081
"As the party of home ownership, we want to go further and faster  and this manifesto sets out our plan.",404,1083
"At its heart, a clear objective to build affordable homes,",404,1084
"including 200,000 Starter Homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent discount, and will be built exclusively for first time buyers under the age of 40.",403,1085
"At the same time, we will extend our Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme,",403,1086
"introduce a new Help to Buy ISA,",403,1087
extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants,403,1088
"and make sure that, when it comes to planning decisions, local people are in charge.",403,1089
"And for all those already in their home, we will make sure we continue working through our economic plan, so mortgage rates stay lower for longer and people can keep hold of their homes and plan for the future",404,1090
 safe in the knowledge they have a government that is competently looking after the public finances so they can look after their own.,404,1091
We are setting an ambition to double the number of first-time buyers compared to the last five years  helping one million more people to own their own home.,409,1095
"We will extend Help to Buy to cover another 120,000 homes  in total helping over 200,000 people",409,1096
"and we will continue the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee until the start of 2017,",409,1097
and the Help to Buy equity loan until at least 2020.,409,1098
"From this autumn, we will introduce a new Help to Buy ISA to support people who are working hard to save up for a deposit for their first home.",409,1099
"A ten per cent deposit on the average first home costs £15,000, so if you put in up to £12,000, government will put in up to £3,000 more.",409,1100
A 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving a deposit from your pre-tax income  making it effectively a tax cut for first-time buyers.,409,1101
"We will build 200,000 quality Starter Homes over the course of the next Parliament, reserved for first-time buyers under 40 and sold at 20 per cent below the market price.",409,1104
"We have delivered over 217,000 new affordable homes since 2010.",404,1105
"We will now go further, delivering 275,000 additional affordable homes by 2020.",404,1106
"And we will offer 10,000 new homes to rent at below market rates, to help people save for a deposit.",409,1107
We will extend the Right to Buy to tenants in Housing Associations to enable more people to buy a home of their own.,404,1109
It is unfair that they should miss out on a right enjoyed by tenants in local authority homes.,503,1110
"We will fund the replacement of properties sold under the extended Right to Buy by requiring local authorities to manage their housing assets more efficiently, with the most expensive properties sold off and replaced as they fall vacant.",404,1111
We will also create a Brownfield Fund to unlock homes on brownfield land for additional housing.,404,1112
"We aim at least to double the number of custom-built and self-built homes by 2020, and we will take forward a new Right to Build, requiring councils to allocate land to local people to build or commission their own home, as you can do in most of Europe.",410,1114
We have safeguarded national Green Belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces.,501,1116
We have abolished the Labour Governments top-down Regional Strategies which sought to delete the Green Belt in and around 30 towns and cities and introduced a new Local Green Space planning designation which allows councils and neighbourhood plans to give added protection to valuable local green spaces.,416,1117
"We will support locally-led garden cities and towns in places where communities want them, such as Ebbsfleet and Bicester.",416,1119
"When new homes are granted planning permission, we will make sure local communities know up-front that necessary infrastructure such as schools and roads will be provided.",411,1120
We will ensure that brownfield land is used as much as possible for new development.,416,1121
"We will require local authorities to have a register of what is available, and ensure that 90 per cent of suitable brownfield sites have planning permission for housing by 2020.",416,1122
"To meet the capitals housing needs, we will create a new London Land Commission, with a mandate to identify and release all surplus brownfield land owned by the public sector.",416,1123
"We will fund Housing Zones to transform brownfield sites into new housing, which will create 95,000 new homes.",416,1124
"Under this Government, average council tax bills in England have fallen, in real terms, by 11 per cent.",404,1127
"Whereas Labour wants to propose a new tax on family homes, we will help local authorities keep council tax low for hardworking taxpayers,",404,1128
and ensure residents can continue to veto high rises via a local referendum.,301,1129
"And in London, where there is a Conservative Mayor, bills have fallen even further.",404,1130
"We will continue to work with councillors to deliver high quality, value for money services.",404,1131
"We will encourage voluntary integration of services and administration between and within councils  for example, with the Troubled Families Programme and the Better Care Fund  to promote savings and improve local services.",301,1132
"We want local councils to help manage public land and buildings, and will give them at least a 10 per cent stake in public sector land sales in their area.",301,1133
We want local authorities to help create strong local economies.,301,1135
"Building on the local retention of business rates introduced in 2012, we will promote localism by allowing councils to keep a higher proportion of the business rates revenue that is generated in their area.",301,1136
This will provide a strong financial incentive for councils to promote economic growth.,301,1137
We will review how we can further reduce ring-fencing and remove Whitehall burdens to give councils more flexibility to support local services.,301,1138
"We will support Business Improvement Districts and other forms of business-led collaboration on high streets  giving more say to local traders on issues such as minor planning applications, cleaning and parking.",301,1139
"We will continue to support local shops and residents in tackling aggressive parking enforcement and excessive parking charges, and take steps to tackle rogue and unfair practices by private parking operators.",301,1140
"Our Coastal Communities Fund will help our seaside areas thrive, helping to boost skills and create jobs.",301,1141
We set ourselves the goal of being the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than that in which we found it.,501,1144
This is a big ambition to which we remain committed. We will:,501,1145
put in place a new Blue Belt to protect precious marine habitats,501,1146
invest in cleaner air and water for you and your family,501,1147
keep our forests in trust for the nation,501,1148
"For Conservatives, Britains green and pleasant land is not some relic from a bygone era, to be mourned and missed: its the living, breathing backdrop to our national life.",601,1149
"Our moors and meadows, wildlife and nature, air and water are a crucial part of our national identity and make our country what it is.",601,1150
"So we care about them deeply, want to protect them for everyone and pass them onto future generations.",601,1151
Labour never understood this.,601,1152
Our rural communities fell further behind urban areas;,503,1153
"biodiversity suffered, with important species and habitats declining under their watch;",501,1154
and they failed to protect the Green Belt.,501,1155
"Over the last five years, we have committed billions of pounds to reduce emissions from transport and clean up our rivers and seas.",501,1156
"We have done more to protect our seas, safeguarded our Green Belt and planted 11 million trees.",501,1157
"And we set out a comprehensive, long-term vision to protect our natural heritage in this countrys first White Paper on the Natural Environment for 20 years.",501,1158
"Over the next five years, we will put in place stronger protections for our natural landscapes,",501,1159
"establish a new Blue Belt to safeguard precious marine habitats,",501,1160
launch a programme of pocket parks in towns and cities,501,1161
and continue to lead in tackling the illegal wildlife trade.,501,1162
Our plan is to conserve and enhance our natural environment so that this remains the most beautiful country in the world.,601,1163
"We will spend £3 billion from the Common Agricultural Policy to enhance Englands countryside over the next five years,",501,1166
"enabling us, among other things, to clean up our rivers and lakes,",501,1167
"protect our stonewalls and hedges,",501,1168
and help our bees to thrive.,501,1169
We will ensure that our public forests and woodland are kept in trust for the nation and plant another 11 million trees.,501,1170
"We will make it easier to access our beautiful landscapes, by providing free, comprehensive maps of all open-access green space.",501,1171
"Building on our introduction of a five pence charge on single-use plastic bags, we will review the case for higher Fixed Penalty Notices for littering and allow councils to tackle small-scale fly-tipping through Fixed Penalties rather than costly prosecutions.",501,1172
We will launch an ambitious programme of pocket parks  small areas of inviting public space where people can enjoy relief from the hustle and bustle of city streets.,501,1173
"We will protect the Green Belt,",501,1174
"and maintain national protections for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty,",501,1175
"National Parks,",501,1176
Sites of Special Scientific Interest,501,1177
and other environmental designations.,501,1178
"We will continue to do even more to tackle air pollution and clean up our rivers and waterways, including supporting the Thames Tideway Tunnel.",501,1180

"We will now go further, building 1,400 new flood defence schemes, to protect 300,000 homes.",501,1182
"We will build new roads and railways in a way that limits, as far as possible, their impact on the environment.",501,1184
"This includes investing £300 million in cutting light pollution from new roads,",501,1185
"doing more tunnelling,",501,1186
building better noise barriers,501,1187
and helping to restore lost habitat.,501,1188
We will also replace locally any biodiversity lost in the construction of High Speed 2.,501,1189
"We set up the Natural Capital Committee to put hard economic numbers on the value of our environment, and we will extend its life to at least the end of the next Parliament.",501,1190
"We will work with it to develop a 25 Year Plan to restore the UKs biodiversity,",501,1191

"We will designate a further protected area at Ascension Island, subject to the views of the local community.",501,1197
"And, off our own coasts, we will complete the network of Marine Conservation Zones that we have already started, to create a UK Blue Belt of protected sites.",501,1198
"The quality of the food on your plate, and the economic security of our farmers, depend on us upholding the highest standards of animal welfare.",501,1200
We will push for high animal welfare standards to be incorporated into international trade agreements and into reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.,501,1201
We will ban wild animals in circuses,501,1202
and press for all EU member states to ensure that animals are only sent to slaughterhouses that meet high welfare standards.,501,1203

help you insulate your home,403,1220
halt the spread of subsidised onshore wind farms,403,1221
"meet our climate change commitments, cutting carbon emissions as cheaply as possible, to save you money",403,1222
"Without secure energy supplies, we leave British families and business at the mercy of fluctuating global oil and gas prices;",403,1223
we increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy; and we become less safe and less prosperous as a result.,403,1224
National energy policy demands a willingness to take decisions today for the good of tomorrow.,403,1225
But Labour took the opposite approach.,403,1226
Power margins  the safety cushion we need to prevent blackouts  have fallen to record lows because of their historic failure to invest in new capacity.,403,1227
Domestic sources of oil and gas were unexploited.,403,1228
"And Labour failed to deliver the next generation of energy projects that will help us keep the lights on, drive bills down and reduce carbon emissions.",403,1229
All this hurt consumers.,403,1230
"The number of major energy suppliers halved and energy bills soared, with the average gas bill more than doubling.",403,1231
We have taken a different approach.,403,1232
"Where Labour was chronically short-termist, we have secured decent, affordable energy supplies not just for the coming years, but for the coming decades.",404,1233
Our long-term plan has unlocked £59 billion of investment in electricity.,404,1234
"All parts of the UK will soon be helping to deliver secure, affordable and low-carbon energy,",404,1235

the next generation of pipelines West of Shetland,404,1238
and the Swansea tidal lagoon.,404,1239
"Our tax cuts have encouraged record levels of investment in existing North Sea gas,",402,1240
"and the birth of a new industry, shale gas,",410,1241
which could create many thousands of jobs.,701,1242
And we have delivered a better deal for consumers too.,403,1244
We have demanded that energy companies simplify their tariffs;,403,1245
encouraged more independent suppliers  which now account for ten per cent of the household market;,403,1246
and made it much easier for people to switch energy providers.,403,1247
But the job is only half done.,403,1248
We need a Conservative Government to see through this long-term plan and secure clean but affordable energy supplies for generations to come.,404,1249
This means a significant expansion in new nuclear and gas;,410,1250

and pushing for more new investment in UK energy sources.,410,1252
"Healthy competition, not short-termist political intervention, is the best way to secure a good deal for consumers.",403,1253
So we will keep on relentlessly pushing for more competition to keep bills low.,403,1254
This is a long-term plan to keep the lights on;,404,1255
keep our homes warm;,404,1256
and keep families from endless worry about their energy bills.,404,1257
"We have helped increase the number of independent energy suppliers from seven to 21,",403,1261
"made it easier for customers to switch to better deals,",403,1262
"slashed the number of tariffs to just 4 per supplier,",403,1263

"We will ensure that every home and business in the country has a Smart Meter by 2020, delivered as cost-effectively as possible, so consumers have instant, accurate bills and can switch to an alternative provider within one day.",403,1266

Onshore wind now makes a meaningful contribution to our energy mix and has been part of the necessary increase in renewable capacity.,416,1280
"Onshore windfarms often fail to win public support, however, and are unable by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable energy system requires.",416,1281
"As a result, we will end any new public subsidy for them and change the law so that local people have the final say on windfarm applications.",416,1282
"We have been the greenest government ever, setting up the worlds first Green Investment Bank,",501,1284
"signing a deal to build the first new nuclear plant in a generation, trebling renewable energy generation to 19 per cent,",416,1285
"bringing energy efficiency measures to over one million homes,",416,1286
and committing £1 billion for carbon capture and storage.,416,1287
We are the largest offshore wind market in the world.,501,1288
We will push for a strong global climate deal later this year  one that keeps the goal of limiting global warming to two-degrees firmly in reach.,501,1289
"At home, we will continue to support the UK Climate Change Act.",501,1290

"Crime is down by more than 20 per cent since 2010, according to the independent Crime Survey, and is at its lowest point since records began.",605,1303
"Lower crime means fewer robberies, less violence on our streets, fewer lives ruined, and more people able to feel confident about the future.",605,1304
"Labour didnt trust our brilliant policemen and women, probation staff and prison officers to do their job, but tried to micromanage every police force from Whitehall,",605,1305
"doing serious damage to officer morale, police discretion and forces performance.",605,1306
"And Labour failed to provide sufficient prison places: tens of thousands of prisoners were released early, putting the public at risk.",605,1307

The first duty of government is to keep you safe.,202,1402
We will always do whatever is necessary to protect the British people.,601,1403
We have protected and increased the budgets for the security and intelligence agencies and counter-terrorism policing.,605,1404
"But the scale of the threat to our country from a number of terrorist groups remains serious,",601,1405
"and the rise of ISIL in Syria and Iraq has created new havens for terrorists from which attacks against Britain can be planned, financed and directed.",601,1406
"However, the nature of the threat we face is making it more difficult for the security services to identify terrorist plots  especially thanks to new technology.",605,1408
We must always ensure our outstanding intelligence and security agencies have the powers they need to keep us safe.,605,1409
"At the same time, we continue to reject any suggestions of sweeping, authoritarian measures that would threaten our hard-won freedoms.",605,1410
"In the last year alone, we have given the authorities greater powers to disrupt and control the movements of people who want to travel abroad to fight,",605,1411

"We will keep up to date the ability of the police and security services to access communications data  the who, where, when and how of a communication, but not its content.",605,1426

We have already reformed the Prevent strategy so that it focuses on non-violent as well as violent extremism.,605,1432
We will now go even further.,605,1433

"In office, Labour neglected the elderly.",503,1455
They raided pensions with a £150 billion stealth tax.,503,1456
One year they increased pensions by a paltry 75 pence.,503,1457
"And they did nothing to give people control over their savings and pensions, or to stop them from having to sell their homes to pay for care.",503,1458
"In place of these meagre pension increases, we have introduced the triple lock:",504,1459
"the Basic State Pension will now always rise in line with whichever is higher  earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent.",504,1460

"In the next five years, as our country recovers and our elderly population grows, we will continue to put pensioners at the heart of our long-term economic plan.",503,1472
"We will cap charges for residential social care from April 2016 and also allow deferred payment agreements, so no one has to sell their home.",504,1475
"For the first time, individual liabilities will be limited, giving everyone the peace of mind that they will receive the care they need, and that they will be protected from unlimited costs if they develop very serious care needs  such as dementia.",504,1476
We will protect the NHS budget,504,1477
and we will prioritise funding for dementia research.,504,1478
We will keep the triple lock pension system.,504,1481
From April 2016 we are bringing in a Single Tier Pension; this will effectively abolish means-testing the pensions of people who have contributed all their lives.,504,1482
"We will maintain all the current pensioner benefits including Winter Fuel Payments, free bus passes, free prescriptions and TV licences for the next Parliament, while implementing the ""temperature test"" for Winter Fuel Payment, so that expats in hot countries no longer receive it",504,1483
"And we will allow pensioners to access their pension savings and decide whether or not to take out an annuity, so they can make their own decisions about their money.",504,1484
"We have guaranteed that ISAs can now be passed on to a spouse tax-free, so that from this April they are no longer subject to Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax.",504,1486

"Without the ability to raise money, the devolved Parliaments were not accountable to taxpayers.",301,1504
"Without devolution to local councils and communities, power felt as distant as ever.",301,1505
"And one fundamental unfairness remains today: Scottish MPs are able to cast the decisive vote on matters that only affected England and Wales, while English and Welsh MPs cannot vote on matters that only affect Scotland.",204,1506
This leaves a space for resentment to fester  and put our Union in jeopardy.,204,1507
We have tackled the problems we inherited.,301,1508
"First, we held the referendum on Scottish independence.",301,1509

"We have agreed with Northern Irelands parties a deal to help ensure that politics works, the economy grows and society is more cohesive and united.",301,1512
And we have set out clear plans for English votes for English laws.,301,1513
All this reflects a core Conservative belief: power to the people.,301,1514
Around Britain you can see that principle in practice.,601,1515
"In town halls, councillors now have more of a say over public spending.",301,1516
"In communities, local people have the right to vote in referendums on council tax rises.",301,1517
Neighbourhoods are deciding what is built in their area and what happens to assets such as parks and public buildings.,301,1518
Our commitment to the Union means we want to strengthen it.,301,1520
We will let local people have more say on local planning and let them vote on local issues.,301,1521
"We will not let anyone impose artificial regions on England  our traditional towns, boroughs, cities and counties are here to stay.",301,1522
"We will continue devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales, and implement the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland.",301,1523
"And we will give English MPs a veto over English-only matters, including on Income Tax  answering the West Lothian Question.",204,1524
"In the last five years, we have proven that we are the party of the Union.",301,1525
"We will go further in the next Parliament, pushing power out beyond Westminster, Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont, so we keep our United Kingdom strong and secure for the long term.",301,1526
"We will work to ensure a stable constitution that is fair to the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.",203,1529
We will strengthen and improve devolution for each part of our United Kingdom in a way that accepts that there is no one-size-fits-all solution:,301,1530
"we will implement the Smith Commission and St Davids Day Agreement or equivalent changes in the rest of the UK, including English votes for English laws.",301,1531
We will maintain the Westminster Parliament as the UK and Englands law-making body.,203,1533
"But we want Parliament to work in a way that ensures decisions affecting England, or England and Wales, can only be taken with the consent of the majority of MPs representing constituencies in England, or in England and Wales.",204,1534
"We will end the manifest unfairness whereby Scotland is able to decide its own laws in devolved areas, only for Scottish MPs also to be able to have the potentially decisive say on similar matters that affect only England and Wales.",204,1535
"We will maintain the integrity of the UK Parliament by ensuring that MPs from all parts of the UK continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set overall spending levels.",301,1536
But we will: change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of legislation affecting only England or England and Wales will be considered by a Committee drawn in proportion to party strength in England or England and Wales.,204,1537
"add a new stage to how English legislation is passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to England would be able to pass to its Third Reading and become law without being approved through a legislative consent motion by a Grand Committee made up of all English MPs, or all English and Welsh MPs.",204,1538
extend the principle of English consent to financial matters such as how spending is distributed within England and to taxation  including an English rate of Income Tax  when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland.,301,1539
A new Scotland Bill will be in our first Queens Speech and will be introduced in the first session of a new Parliament.,301,1541
We will implement the recommendations of the Smith Commission so that more than 50 per cent of the Scottish Parliaments budget will be funded from revenues raised in Scotland,301,1542
and it will have significant new welfare powers to complement existing devolved powers in health and social care.,301,1543
We will provide the Scottish Parliament with one of the most extensive packages of tax and spending powers of any devolved legislature in the world.,301,1544
We will retain the Barnett Formula as the basis for determining the grant to cover that part of the Scottish Parliaments budget not funded by tax revenues raised in Scotland.,301,1545
"We will agree new rules with the Scottish Government for how the block grant will be adjusted, to take account of the new devolved tax and welfare powers.",301,1546
"And we will ensure that where responsibility for taxation has been devolved, tax changes only affect public spending in that part of the country.",301,1547
We will clarify the division of powers between Wales and the UK Government.,301,1549
"We will: devolve to the Welsh Assembly control over its own affairs including the Assembly name, size and electoral system, Assembly elections and voting age.",301,1550
implement other recommendations of the second Silk Report where there is all-party support as set out in the St Davids Day Agreement;,301,1551
this will include devolving to the Welsh Assembly important economic powers over ports and energy consents.,301,1552
introduce a new Wales Bill if these changes require legislation.,301,1553
continue to reserve policing and justice as matters for the UK Parliament.,301,1554
"introduce a funding floor to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.",301,1555
make the Welsh Government responsible for raising more of the money it spends so the Welsh people can hold their politicians to account.,301,1556
We will maintain Northern Irelands position within the United Kingdom on the basis of the consent of its people.,301,1558
Our strong support for the political institutions established over the past two decades as a result of the various Agreements will continue.,301,1559
"We will : develop and implement our strategy to combat terrorism,",605,1560
giving the strongest possible support to the brave men and women of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.,605,1561
work to implement fully and faithfully the historic Stormont House Agreement to enable devolution to function more effectively;,301,1562
to deal with the legacy of the past;,301,1563
and to make progress on divisive issues such as flags and parading.,301,1564
continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to implement commitments in the 2013 economic pact to rebalance the economy and to build a more united and stronger society.,301,1565
"complete the devolution of Corporation Tax powers to the Assembly, consistent with the Executive fulfilling its commitments on finance, welfare reform and efficiencies in the Stormont House Agreement.",301,1566
"For too long, your voice has been ignored on Europe.",110,1569
"We will: give you a say over whether we should stay in or leave the EU, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017",110,1570
commit to keeping the pound and staying out of the Eurozone,110,1571
"reform the workings of the EU, which is too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic",110,1572
reclaim power from Brussels on your behalf and safeguard British interests in the Single Market,110,1573
back businesses to create jobs in Britain by completing ambitious trade deals and,410,1574
The EU needs to change.,110,1576
And it is time for the British people  not politicians  to have their say.,110,1577
"Only the Conservative Party will deliver real change and real choice on Europe, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.",110,1578
Labour failed to give you a choice on the EU.,110,1579
"They handed over major new powers to Brussels without your consent, and gave away £7 billion of the British rebate.",110,1580
We have taken action in Europe to promote your economic security.,110,1581
"We cut the EU budget for the first time ever, saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion.",110,1582
"We took Britain out of Eurozone bailouts, including for Greece",110,1583
 the first ever return of powers from Brussels.,110,1584
Our Prime Minister vetoed a new EU treaty that would have damaged Britains interests.,110,1585
"And we have pursued a bold, positive, pro-business agenda,",401,1586
"exempting smallest businesses from red tape,",401,1587
"promoting free trade,",401,1588
"and pushing to extend the Single Market to new sectors, like digital.",401,1589
But there is much more to do.,110,1592
The EU is too bureaucratic and too undemocratic.,110,1593
"It interferes too much in our daily lives, and the scale of migration triggered by new members joining in recent years has had a real impact on local communities.",110,1594
We are clear about what we want from Europe.,110,1595
We say: yes to the Single Market.,108,1596
Yes to turbo-charging free trade.,108,1597
Yes to working together where we are stronger together than alone.,108,1598
"Yes to a family of nation states,",108,1599
all part of a European Union,108,1600
" but whose interests, crucially, are guaranteed whether inside the Euro or out.",108,1601
No to ever closer union.,110,1602
No to a constant flow of power to Brussels.,110,1603
No to unnecessary interference.,110,1604
"And no, of course, to the Euro,",110,1605
to participation in Eurozone bail-outs,110,1606
or notions like a European Army.,110,1607
It will be a fundamental principle of a future Conservative Government that membership of the European Union depends on the consent of the British people,110,1608
 and in recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin.,110,1609
"Thats why, after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in Europe,",110,1610
and then ask the British people whether they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave.,110,1611
David Cameron has committed that he will only lead a government that offers an in-out referendum.,110,1612
We will hold that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcome.,110,1613
So the choice at this election is clear: Labour and the Liberal Democrats wont give you a say over the EU.,110,1614
UKIP cant give you a say.,110,1615
Only the Conservative Party will deliver real change in Europe,110,1616
 and only the Conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendum.,110,1617
We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britains membership of the EU before the end of 2017.,110,1620
We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU.,110,1621
"And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave.",110,1622
"We will honour the result of the referendum, whatever the outcome.",110,1623
We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone.,110,1625
The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the United Kingdom.,110,1626
We benefit from the Single Market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.,108,1627
"Indeed, given the trade between Britain and the Eurozone countries we want to see these economies returning to growth.",108,1628
But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the Single Market or in any way disadvantage the UK.,110,1629
"We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it.",110,1631
"We have already taken action to return around 100 powers, but we want to go further.",110,1632
We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.,110,1633
"And we want an end to our commitment to an ever closer union, as enshrined in the Treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.",110,1634
"Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that defence policy remains firmly under British national control,",104,1635
maintaining NATO and the transatlantic relationship as the cornerstones of our defence and security policy.,104,1636
We will scrap Labour's Human Rights Act and introduce a British Bill of Rights which will restore common sense to the application of human rights in the UK.,204,1639
"The Bill will remain faithful to the basic principles of human rights, which we signed up to in the original European Convention on Human Rights.",201,1640
"It will protect basic rights, like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are an essential part of a modern democratic society.",201,1641
"But it will reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law being used for more and more purposes, and often with little regard for the rights of wider society.",204,1642
Among other things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign criminals who pose a threat to our society from using spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.,204,1643
"We want an EU that helps Britain move ahead, not one that holds us back.",401,1645
"We have already succeeded in exempting our smallest businesses from new EU regulations,",401,1646
"and kicked-off negotiations for a massive EU trade deal with the USA, which could be worth billions of pounds to the UK economy.",401,1647
We will build on this.,401,1648
"We want to preserve the integrity of the Single Market, by insisting on protections for those countries that have kept their own currencies.",406,1649
"We want to expand the Single Market, breaking down the remaining barriers to trade and ensuring that new sectors are opened up to British firms.",401,1650
"We want to ensure that new rules target unscrupulous behaviour in the financial services industry,",403,1651
while safeguarding Britain as a global centre of excellence in finance.,401,1652
So we will resist EU attempts to restrict legitimate financial services activities.,401,1653
"We will press for lower EU spending,",110,1654
"further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and Structural Funds,",110,1655
and for EU money to be focused on promoting jobs and growth.,110,1656
Everything we do around the world will be driven by a determination to protect your security and help you prosper.,601,1659
"We will: ensure Britain is a major player on the world stage,",601,1660
"using diplomacy to protect your interests, uphold British values",601,1661
and tackle threats to your security and prosperity,605,1662
"help generate new trade, investment and job opportunities, to benefit you and your family",410,1663
maintain our world class Armed Forces so they continue to guarantee your security,104,1664
uphold our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on international development.,107,1665
Economic security and national security are two sides of the same coin.,601,1666
"Without one, you cannot have the other.",601,1667
"Our prosperity depends upon Britain remaining an active, outward-looking nation, one that is engaged with the world, not looking in on itself.",601,1668
We will maintain Britains strong global role and our capacity to project British power and values around the world.,601,1669
Labours Great Recession weakened Britain on the world stage.,601,1671
"They left a £38 billion black hole in the defence budget,",104,1672
"went 12 years without conducting a Strategic Defence Review,",104,1673
"and, at times, failed to provide our Armed Forces with the equipment they needed in Afghanistan.",104,1674
"They shut down over 30 British diplomatic missions,",107,1675
"failed to plan properly for Iraqs reconstruction,",107,1676
"ignored trade and investment opportunities overseas,",401,1677
and neglected vital relationships.,107,1678
We have strengthened Britains influence in the world.,601,1679
"The National Security Council that we established ensures proper, strategic decision-making at the top of government.",104,1680
"We have boosted exports to emerging markets,",401,1681
"opened new diplomatic posts in Africa, Asia and Latin America,",107,1682
and led the world in promoting womens rights and tackling sexual violence in conflict.,201,1683
We have balanced the defence budget,414,1684
and set out a clear strategy to defend our nation for the long term.,104,1685
We and our allies face major challenges:,107,1686
"Islamist extremism, an aggressive Russia, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, nuclear proliferation and infectious diseases.",107,1687
A Conservative Government will tackle these challenges.,305,1688
"We will use our membership of NATO,",104,1689
"the EU,",108,1690
"the Commonwealth,",101,1691
"our UN Security Council seat,",107,1692
"our Special Relationship with the USA,",101,1693
"our intelligence agencies,",104,1694
"vital institutions like the BBC World Service and British Council,",601,1695
"and the strong personal links between our diaspora communities and other countries, to achieve the best for Britain.",601,1696
We will back this up with UK military power,104,1698
and international aid.,107,1699
"Our long-term economic plan will ensure we have the economic strength to maintain our world-class Armed Forces,",104,1700
to uphold our national security,104,1701
and project power globally.,104,1702
Aid helps prevent failed states from becoming havens for terrorists.,107,1703
"It builds long-term markets for our businesses,",107,1704
"by promoting global prosperity,",107,1705
and reduces migration pressures.,107,1706
"So we will maintain our commitment to tackling conflict, poverty and disease around the world.",107,1707
We will tackle global terrorism and the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism,104,1711
"while taking a patient, long-term approach to preventing conflict and state failure.",105,1712

"We will promote girls education,",201,1857
encourage equal access to property rights,201,1858
and work to achieve access to family planning for everyone who wants it.,201,1859
"We will continue to lead efforts to tackle violence against women and girls, end FGM",201,1860
"and combat early and forced marriage, both at home and abroad.",201,1861
Our International Citizen Service has given thousands of young Brits the opportunity to volunteer abroad.,107,1863
We will triple it in size.,107,1864
"We will also double our successful Aid Match scheme, which matches donations to charity from the aid budget.",107,1865
"We will boost partnerships between UK institutions and their counterparts in the developing world,",107,1866
and help people in the UK give or lend money directly to individuals and entrepreneurs around the world.,107,1867
"Like generations before us, we are living through a time of profound national change.",305.3,3
"At such moments, our country requires strong and stable leadership that is capable of taking the right long-term decisions for the United Kingdoms future security and prosperity.",305.3,4
"Since the referendum result last summer, that is what the government has delivered.",305.1,5
"Despite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, we have seen confidence remain high,",410,6
record numbers of jobs,701,7
and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations.,410,8
A new Conservative government will stick to the plan that has delivered stability and certainty.,305.1,9
"Over and above this plan, we know that we need to take the right long-term decisions for our future security",104,10
and prosperity.,410,11
"In doing so, we will make sure that Britain not only meets the challenges of the future but grasps the opportunities these challenges present.",305.1,12
This manifesto offers our vision for Britain not just for the next five years but for the years and decades beyond.,601.1,14
"It is a programme for government but it is also a declaration that we intend to achieve what few governments even attempt: we will take the big, sometimes difficult, long-term decisions that are right for our future and for future generations.",305.1,15
"For at this moment of national change, we believe that Britain faces five giant challenges, each of which requires strong leadership, concerted effort and intelligent policy to address.",305.3,16
The need for a strong economy.,410,17
"We need to make the most of our existing strengths,",410,18
"invest in infrastructure and people,",411,19
and ensure that the whole of our economy across the whole of our country can grow.,410,20
"Without a strong economy, we cannot guarantee our security,",104,21
"our personal prosperity,",410,22
"our public services,",504,23
or contented and sustainable communities.,606.1,24
Brexit and a changing world.,110,25
We need to deliver a smooth and orderly departure from the European Union,110,26
and forge a deep and special partnership with our friends and allies across Europe.,108,27
"As there is increasingly little distinction between domestic and international affairs in matters of migration, national security and the economy, Britain must stay strong and united",601.1,28
 and take a lead in the world to defend our interests.,107,29
Enduring social divisions.,503,30
"For too many people, where you end up in life is still determined by where you were born and to whom.",503,31
"We need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to make the most of their talents and hard work, whoever you are and wherever you are from.",503,32
An ageing society.,504,33
"We need to respond to the reality of an ageing society, giving people security in old age and caring for those with long-term health conditions,",504,34
whilst making sure we are fair to younger generations.,503,35
Fast- changing technology.,411,36
"For the sake of our economy and our society, we need to harness the power of fast-changing technology,",411,37
while ensuring that our security and personal privacy  and the welfare of children and younger people  are protected.,605.1,38
"If we do not take decisions now to address these challenges, our country risks becoming weaker, poorer and less stable;",503,40
"but if we show leadership and grasp the opportunities that these giant challenges present, Britain can emerge from Brexit, look beyond it and launch into the future with confidence.",305.3,41
"To do that, we will need to govern in the manner established by Theresa May since she became prime minister last year.",305.2,42
We must reject the ideological templates provided by the socialist left and the libertarian right and instead embrace the mainstream view that recognises the good that government can do.,305.3,43
"Rather than pursue an agenda based on a supposed centre ground defined and established by elites in Westminster, we will govern in the interests of the mainstream of the British public.",305.1,44
We will get on with the job and take Britain out of the European Union.,110,45
We will restore the public finances and maintain economic stability.,414,46
We will reduce and control immigration.,601.2,47
We will be resolute in defending the country from terrorism and other security threats.,104,48
We will also stand up to those in positions of power who abuse that privilege.,304,49
We will run public services in accordance with their values as important local and national institutions.,504,50
We will not only guarantee but enhance workers rights and protections.,701,51
"And we will develop our ambitious modern industrial strategy to get the economy working for everyone, across the whole of our nation.",503,52
"Under the strong and stable leadership of Theresa May, there will be no ideological crusades.",305.2,53
The governments agenda will not be allowed to drift to the right.,305.1,54
Our starting point is that we should take decisions on the basis of what works.,305.1,55
"And we will always be guided by what matters to the ordinary, working families of this nation.",701,56
"As Theresa May said when she first became prime minister, the work of the government under her leadership will be driven not for the benefit of a privileged few but by the interests of ordinary, working families:",701,58
people who have a job but do not always have job security;,701,59
people who own their own home but worry about paying the mortgage;,701,60
people who can just about manage but worry about the cost of living and geting their children into a good school.,701,61
"These families have been ignored by politicians, and by others in positions of power, for too long.",701,62
"Yet they do not ask for much: they want to get on with their lives, to do their best for their children, to have a fair chance.",603,63
"Under Theresa Mays leadership, they will no longer be ignored.",701,64
They are the people to whom this manifesto is dedicated.,701,65
They are the people who work hard every day and make this country what it is.,701,66
And they are the people who deserve strong and stable leadership from a government that is determined to address the five giant challenges we face  and make the right long-term decisions for the future of the United Kingdom.,305.3,67
"To do that, we will need a state that is strong and strategic, nimble and responsive to the needs of people.",305.3,69
"While it is never true that government has all the answers, government can and should be a force for good",305.3,70
 and its power should be put squarely at the service of this countrys working people.,701,71
"If we are going to keep our economy strong as the world changes, we will need government to play an active role, leading a modern industrial strategy to make the most of Britains strengths and take advantage of new opportunities",411,72
" bringing secure, well-paid jobs to the whole of the country.",701,73
"If we are going to make sure Britain emerges from Brexit as a strong and united nation, we will need strong leadership and good government:",305.3,74
"to get the right deal for Britain in Europe,",110,75
to strike new trade deals around the world,407,76
and to make sure our economy is strong for the years ahead.,410,77
"If we want to overcome Britains enduring social divisions, we will need to give people real opportunity and make Britain the worlds Great Meritocracy.",503,78
"That will require government to take on long-ignored problems like Britains lack of training and technical education,",411,79
"as well as long-lasting injustices, such as the lack of care for people with mental health problems,",504,80
"and the inequality of opportunity that endures on the basis of race, gender and class.",503,81
"If we are going to cope with our ageing society and if we want to give security to people in old age while being fair to younger generations, we are going to need positive, active government that will deal with increased demand for social care,",504,82
fund and improve our National Health Service,504,83
and build more houses across the country.,504,84
We will need to take sometimes difficult decisions that ask more of one generation in order to help another.,606.1,85
"If we are going to respond to rapid changes in technology, we need government to make Britain the best place in the world to set up and run modern businesses,",411,86
bringing the jobs of the future to our country;,701,87
but we also need government to create the right regulatory frameworks that will protect our security and personal privacy,201.1,88
", and ensure the welfare of children and younger people in an age when so much of life is conducted online.",605.1,89
Government alone cannot solve every challenge our country faces.,606.1,90
"Without business and enterprise, there would be no prosperity and no public services.",401,91
"Without the obligations and duties of citizenship, society would not function.",606.1,92
"Without individual responsibility, nothing can be achieved.",606.1,93
"But for a country to remain stable, an economy to be strong, a society to stay healthy, we need a partnership between the individual and the wider nation,",606.1,94
"between private sector and public service,",606.1,95
and the strong leadership only government can provide.,305.3,96
We believe these things not despite the fact that we are Conservatives but because we are Conservatives.,305.1,98
Because Conservatism is not and never has been the philosophy described by caricaturists.,603,99
We do not believe in untrammelled free markets.,403,100
We reject the cult of selfish individualism.,603,101
"We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and inequality.",503,102
We see rigid dogma and ideology not just as needless but dangerous.,202.1,103
True Conservatism means a commitment to country and community;,603,104
a belief not just in society but in the good that government can do;,305.3,105
a respect for the local and national institutions that bind us together;,606.1,106
"an insight that change is inevitable and change can be good, but that change should be shaped, through strong leadership and clear principles, for the common good.",606.1,107
We know that our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals.,606.1,108
"We know that we all have obligations to one another, because that is what community and nation demands.",606.1,109
"We understand that nobody, however powerful, has succeeded alone and that we all therefore have a debt to others.",606.1,110
"We respect the fact that society is a contract between the generations: a partnership between those who are living, those who have lived before us, and those who are yet to be born.",606.1,111
"If we allow ourselves to be directed by these principles,",606.1,113
"if we have strong and stable leadership,",104,114
"and if we address the five giant challenges faced by Britain,",104,115
we believe that the future of our country is a bright one.,601.1,116
"We are already the fifth largest economy in the world,",601.1,117
the biggest recipient of foreign investment in Europe,408,118
and the fastest growing economy in the G7.,410,119
We have three of the worlds top ten universities,506,120
"and, despite forming less than one per cent of the global population, we boast more Nobel Laureates than any country other than America.",601.1,121
We have the finest intelligence services and hugely respected armed forces that can project power around the globe.,104,122
"We have the greatest soft power of any nation,",601.1,123
"we sit in exactly the right time zone for global trade,",407,124
"our capital city is the global capital of finance and culture,",601.1,125
and our language is the language of the world.,601.1,126
So there is no doubt that a country as great as ours can  with strong and stable leadership  rise to the giant challenges we face:,601.1,127
to make sure our economy stays strong,410,128
and to bring prosperity to the whole of our country;,503,129
"to emerge from Brexit a strong and united nation,",606.1,130
able to take a lead in the world to defend Britains interests;,601.1,131
to overcome social divisions by giving people real opportunity and making Britain the worlds Great Meritocracy;,503,132
to restore the contract between the generations that provides security for older people while being fair to the young; and,503,133
"to seize the opportunities of changing technology,",411,134
while ensuring that our security,104,135
and personal privacy,201.1,136
 and the welfare of children and younger people  are still protected.,504,137
Britain is a great nation.,601.1,138
We have a glorious history but we believe that our best days lie ahead of us.,601.1,139
"With this plan to tackle the five giant challenges we face, with our proposals to establish a stronger Britain and a prosperous future, we will, as a nation, go forward, together.",601.1,140
"Theresa Mays Conservatives will deliver A strong economy built on sound public finances,",414,142
"low taxes,",408,143
better regulation,403,144
and free trade deals with markets around the world.,407,145
"A new deal for ordinary, working people giving them a decent living wage",412,146
and new rights and protections in the workplace.,701,147
"Fairer corporate governance, built on new rules for takeovers, executive pay and worker representation on company boards.",405,148
Growth across the country through our modern industrial strategy,410,149
"and major investment in infrastructure, skills and research and development.",411,150
Competitive and affordable energy costs following a new independent review into the cost of energy.,403,151
"Prosperous towns and cities,",410,152
"underpinned by strong local institutions,",301,153
"the relocation of government functions,",301,154
and shared cultural assets across the country.,502,155
A strong economy is the basis for everything we want to achieve as a nation.,408,156
"If we are to have the prosperity, security and quality of life that Britain desires, we need to have an economy that is vibrant and robust.",410,157
But our economy also needs to be equitable.,503,158
"For in Britain today, there is a division between those people and places that have benefited from a changed global market, where opportunity is displayed in affluence and a good quality of life; and those people and places that have experienced a struggling economy, where opportunity has receded and people worry about their childrens futures.",503,159
This is not right.,503,160
So we will forge an economy that works for everyone in every part of this country.,503,161
"We will found our plans on the principles of sound public finances,",414,162
"low taxes,",408,163
free trade,407,164
and effective regulation.,403,165
We will set rules for businesses that inspire the confidence of workers and investors alike.,403,166
"That is only the foundation, however.",411,167
"With our modern industrial strategy, we will build an economy that invests for the long term and supports growth across the whole country  not just in those places that have done well in the past few decades but also where prosperity has waned.",411,168
"Governments cannot use public money to prop up failing businesses,",401,169
but they also cannot allow people and their communities to be cast aside.,403,170
It is our duty to bring opportunity to every part of our nation and to ensure that we all prosper together.,503,171
Sound money and responsible public finances are the essential foundations of national economic success.,414,173
A government that cannot manage its money properly cannot command confidence at home or with international investors.,414,174
Firms and households cannot plan ahead if the governments thirst for their cash threatens higher taxes and cuts to vital services and investment;,414,175
"and when things spiral out of control, it is ordinary, working people who are hit hardest.",701,176
The Conservatives have laid these essential foundations.,414,177
"Ten years after the banking crisis, the deficit is back to where it was.",414,178
The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the national debt is finally about to start falling.,414,179
"There is still work to do on deficit reduction, so we will continue to restore the public finances over the course of the next parliament.",414,180
"We will continue with the fiscal rules announced by the chancellor in the autumn statement last year, which will guide us to a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade.",414,181
This is our foundation.,414,182
"The time has now come to focus on Britains next big economic challenge: to foster growth that works for everyone, right across our country.",503,183
"Paying your fair share of tax is the price of living in a civilised democracy but politicians should never forget that taxes are levied on businesses that employ people, and individuals who work hard and face tough decisions about how they spend their money.",201.1,185
The Conservatives will always be the party that keeps tax as low as possible and spends the proceeds responsibly.,414,186
It is our firm intention to reduce taxes on Britains businesses,402,187
and working families.,701,188
"By 2020, we will, as promised, increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and the higher rate to £50,000.",408,189
We will continue to ensure that local residents can veto high increases in Council Tax via a referendum.,202.4,190
And we will not increase the level of Value Added Tax.,403,191
"Corporation Tax is due to fall to seventeen per cent by 2020  the lowest rate of any developed economy  and we will stick to that plan, because it will help to bring huge investment and many thousands of jobs to the UK.",402,192
We know that the business rates system presents considerable challenges to some smaller companies.,402,193
That is why we have supported those businesses most affected by the recent revaluation of business rates.,402,194
That is not all we will do.,402,195
We will make longerterm reforms to the system to address concerns about the way it currently works.,402,196
"We will make sure that revaluations are conducted more frequently to avoid large changes to the bills that businesses face,",402,197
and explore the introduction of self-assessments in the valuation process.,402,198
To ensure the system is sustainable for the future we will also conduct a full review of the business rates system to make sure it is up to date for a world in which people increasingly shop online.,403,199
"A good tax system is not just about the headline rates of tax, however, but about its simplicity.",303,200
"Our system remains too complicated, making it hard for people  especially self-employed people and small businesses  to assess their taxes.",303,201
We will therefore simplify the tax system.,303,202
Britain has always been a great trading nation.,407,204
Trade will continue to be crucial to our future growth and prosperity.,407,205
"As we leave the European Union, we want to negotiate a new deep and special partnership with the EU, which will allow free trade between the UK and the EUs member states.",407,206
"As part of the agreement we strike, we want to make sure that there are as few barriers to trade and investment as possible.",407,207
Leaving the European Union also means we will be free to strike our own trade agreements with countries outside the EU.,407,208
"We will ensure immediate stability by lodging new UK schedules with the World Trade Organization, in alignment with EU schedules to which we are bound whilst still a member of the European Union.",407,209
We will seek to replicate all existing EU free trade agreements and support the ratification of trade agreements entered into during our EU membership.,407,210
We will continue to support the global multilateral rules-based trade system.,407,211
We will introduce a Trade Bill in the next parliament.,407,212
We will create a network of Her Majestys Trade Commissioners to head nine new regional overseas posts.,407,213
"These commissioners will lead export promotion, investment and trade policy overseas.",407,214
"We will reconvene the Board of Trade with a membership specifically charged with ensuring that we increase exports from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as England,",407,215
and that trade policy is directly influenced by every part of our United Kingdom.,407,216
"We will work to forge a new culture of exporting among UK businesses, equipping them with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed in the global marketplace,",407,217
and take advantage of new high-growth markets around the world.,407,218
We will take a more active role in supporting British consortia to win the largest and most innovative contracts around the world.,407,219
We will ensure that small and mediumsized businesses are able to identify the right markets and sectors to win vital contracts abroad.,407,220
"We will put UK Export Finance, which ensures that no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance, at the heart of the UKs trade promotion proposition.",407,221
"And we will encourage the world to visit, study and do business in the UK through the GREAT Britain campaign and Visit Britain.",407,222
Regulation is necessary for the proper ordering of any economy and to ensure that people  and their investments  are protected.,403,224
"However, poor and excessive government regulation limits growth for no good reason.",401,225
"So we will continue to regulate more efficiently, saving £9 billion through the Red Tape Challenge and the One-In-Two-Out Rule.",303,226
Reducing the cost of regulation is not just about reducing its volume.,303,227
"The wrong regulatory frameworks can over-reward investors for the risk they are taking in backing a particular project, meaning households and businesses can become systematically overcharged.",408,228
We will therefore examine ways in which the regulation of utilities and transport infrastructure can be improved to deliver a better deal for customers,403,229
and sharper incentives for investment efficiency.,402,230
"Conservatives believe that if you value something, you must be prepared to reform it in order to conserve it.",305.1,232
So it is today with our economy.,408,233
"Capitalism and free markets remain the best way to deliver prosperity and economic security, lifting millions of people out of poverty around the world.",401,234
Markets need rules and these rules need to be updated to reflect our changing economy.,403,235
We must first ensure that everyone is paid fairly for their work.,701,237
"It was a Conservative government that introduced the National Living Wage and as a result, people across the United Kingdom now receive a minimum of £7.50 an hour.",412,238
"A new Conservative government will continue to increase the National Living Wage to 60 per cent of median earnings by 2020 and then by the rate of median earnings, so that people who are on the lowest pay benefit from the same improvements in earnings as higher paid workers.",412,239
"In the modern economy many people choose jobs like driving, delivering and coding, that are highly flexible and can be mixed with other employment.",701,241
This brings considerable advantages to millions of people but we should not ignore the challenges this kind of employment creates.,701,242
"These workers are officially classed as self-employed and therefore have fewer pension entitlements, reduced access to benefits, and no qualification for sick pay and holiday pay.",701,243
"Yet the nature of their work is different from the traditional selfemployed worker who might be a sole trader, a freelancer or running their own business.",701,244
We will make sure that people working in the gig economy are properly protected.,701,245
"Last October, the government commissioned Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, to review the changing labour market.",701,246
"We await his final report but a new Conservative government will act to ensure that the interests of employees on traditional contracts, the selfemployed and those people working in the gig economy are all properly protected.",701,247
"We have taken vigorous action against tax avoidance and evasion, closing the tax gap  the difference between the amount of tax due and the amount collected  to one of the lowest in the world.",605.1,249
We will now go further.,605.1,250
We will legislate for tougher regulation of tax advisory firms.,605.1,251
We will take a more proactive approach to transparency and misuse of trusts.,605.1,252
"We will improve HMRCs capabilities to stamp down on smuggling, including by improving our policing of the border as we leave the European Union.",605.1,253
We will also take further measures to reduce online fraud in Value Added Tax.,605.1,254
Millions of people in this country look forward to a more secure retirement because of their private pension.,505,256
"These pensions exist because employees have saved diligently through their life, often foregoing luxuries and holidays abroad.",505,257
Those people did the right thing.,505,258
"Business owners who abuse pension funds and put them at risk, sometimes for their own lavish enrichment, are entirely in the wrong.",403,259
"The current powers of regulators and the Pension Protection Fund are insufficient to ensure that pension savers, pensioners and prudent company directors are protected from unscrupulous business owners.",403,260
"A Conservative government will act to tighten the rules against such abuse,",403,261
and increase the punishment for those caught mismanaging pension schemes.,605.1,262
"We will build on existing powers to give pension schemes and the Pensions Regulator the right to scrutinise, clear with conditions or in extreme cases stop mergers, takeovers or large financial commitments that threaten the solvency of the scheme.",403,263
"We will also give the Pensions Regulator new powers to issue punitive fines for those found to have wilfully left a pension scheme under-resourced and, if necessary, powers similar to those already held by the Insolvency Service to disqualify the company directors in question.",403,264
We will consider introducing a new criminal offence for company directors who deliberately or recklessly put at risk the ability of a pension scheme to meet its obligations.,605.1,265
Conservatives believe in the rights of business owners.,401,267
"We want to be a global nation that is competitive, outward-looking and open for business",401,268
 the best country in Europe for doing business.,601.1,269
We welcome overseas investment and want investors to succeed here,407,270
but not when success is driven by aggressive asset- stripping or tax avoidance.,605.1,271
We will update the rules that govern mergers and takeovers.,403,272
This will require careful deliberation but we can state now that we will require bidders to be clear about their intentions from the outset of the bid process;,403,273
that all promises and undertakings made in the course of takeover bids can be legally enforced afterwards;,403,274
and that the government can require a bid to be paused to allow greater scrutiny.,403,275
We shall also take action to protect our critical national infrastructure.,411,276
We will ensure that foreign ownership of companies controlling important infrastructure does not undermine British security or essential services.,605.1,277
We have already strengthened ministerial scrutiny and control in respect of civil nuclear power,403,278
"and will take a similarly robust approach across a limited range of other sectors, such as telecoms, defence and energy.",403,279
We believe people should be rewarded for their talents and efforts,401,281
but the public is rightly affronted by the remuneration of some corporate leaders.,403,282
"Senior corporate pay has risen far faster than corporate performance, and the gap between those paid most and those paid least has grown from 47:1 in 1998 to 128:1 in 2015.",503,283
The next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders,405,284
and listed companies will have to publish the ratio of executive pay to broader UK workforce pay.,405,285
"Companies will have to explain their pay policies, particularly complex incentive schemes, better.",405,286
"We will commission an examination of the use of share buybacks, with a view to ensuring these cannot be used artificially to hit performance targets and inflate executive pay.",412,287
The modern joint stock company is a British invention.,601.1,289
"It works because it is rules-based, but the rules need to change as the world changes.",403,290
"Boards should take account of the interests not just of shareholders but employees, suppliers and the wider community.",405,291
"To ensure employees interests are represented at board level, we will change the law to ensure that listed companies will be required either to nominate a director from the workforce, create a formal employee advisory council or assign specific responsibility for employee representation to a designated non-executive director.",405,292
"Subject to sensible safeguards, we will introduce, for employees, a right to request information relating to the future direction of the company.",405,293
These strengthened arrangements will apply to publicly-listed companies.,405,294
We will consult on how we might strengthen the corporate governance of privately-owned businesses.,405,295
"Our modern industrial strategy is designed to deliver a stronger economy that works for everyone  where wealth and opportunity are spread across every community in the United Kingdom, not just the most prosperous places in London and the south east.",503,297
"It will help young people to develop the skills they need to do the high-paid, high-skilled jobs of the future.",411,298
"And it will back Britain for the long term: creating the conditions where successful businesses can emerge and grow, and helping them to invest in the future of our nation.",402,299
"The strategy is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing back old companies from the dead.",402,300
"It is about identifying the industries that are of strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through policies on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development  just the same as in every other major and growing economy in the world.",410,301
It is about identifying the places that have the potential to contribute towards economic growth,410,302
and become homes to millions of new jobs.,701,303
"And, because this is about meeting our economys long term challenges, the industrial strategy will focus on creating the right institutional framework to make the strategy last for decades to come.",404,304
"We will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries into practical products and transform the worlds industries  such as the batteries that will power a new generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles.",411,305
"We will establish funding streams to ensure investment for the long term,",411,306
"and make a modern technical education available to everyone, throughout their lives, to provide the skills they need.",411,307
We will remove the barriers that hold backsmallfirms withbigpotentialandletthemcompetewhengovernmentitselfisthebuyer.,402,308
"We will build on the success of world-beating sectors such as car and aero manufacturing, financial services, life sciences, digital technology and our creative industries, and help other sectors develop the conditions which they need to thrive.",411,309
"We will ensure industry and businesses have access to reliable, cheap and clean power.",411,310
"We will deliver the infrastructure  the road, rail, airports and broadband  that businesses need.",411,311
"Our long-term prosperity depends upon science, technology and innovation.",411,313
The UK has an outstanding science base and many world-leading tech companies.,411,314
We now need to go further.,411,315
Our ambition is that the UK should be the most innovative country in the world.,411,316
"At the last autumn statement, we announced a significant increase in government investment in research and development.",411,317
"We will deliver this and ensure further growth so that overall, as a nation, we meet the current OECD average for investment in R&D  that is, 2.4 per cent of GDP  within ten years, with a longer-term goal of three per cent.",411,318
We will increase the number of scientists working in the UK and enable leading scientists from around the world to work here.,411,319
We will work hard to ensure we have a regulatory environment that encourages innovation.,411,320
Our world-beating universities will lead the expansion of our R&D capacity.,506,322
"We must help them make a success of their discoveries  while they have a number of growing investment funds specialising in spin-outs, we have more to do to replicate the success of similar university funds in the United States.",506,323
"To fix that, we will work to build up the investment funds of our universities across the UK.",506,324
"We want larger, aggregated funds to increase significantly the amounts invested in and by universities.",506,325
"We want universities to enjoy the commercial fruits of their research, through funds that are large enough to list, thereby giving British investors a chance to share in their success.",506,326
"If our modern industrial strategy is to succeed, it must address the UKs slow productivity growth and it must be funded properly from the start.",411,328
So we have launched a new £23 billion National Productivity Investment Fund.,411,329
"The government will target this spending at areas that are critical for productivity: housing, research and development, economic infrastructure and skills.",411,330
"This will include £740 million of digital infrastructure investment, the largestinvestmentinrailways since Victoriantimes,",411,331
£1.1billionto improve local transport,411,332
and £250 million in skills by the end of 2020.,411,333
"The National Productivity Investment Fund will take total spending on housing, economic infrastructure and R&D to £170 billion during the next parliament.",411,334
People have long talked about the need to create UK sovereign wealth funds.,504,336
We will now make this a central part of our long-term plan for Britain.,504,337
"We will create a number of such funds, known as Future Britain funds, which will hold in trust the investments of the British people, backing British infrastructure and the British economy.",504,338
"We anticipate early funds being created out of revenues from shale gas extraction, dormant assets, and the receipts of sale of some public assets.",504,339
We will encourage pension funds with an interest in joining Future Britain funds to do so.,504,340
"As we set out in chapter three, the next Conservative government will give Britain the technical education it has lacked for decades.",411,342
This will take time but we must also address the immediate needs of those sectors of the economy suffering shortages in skills.,411,343
"We will make the immigration system work for these sectors,",411,344
whilst ensuring that we develop the skills we need for the future.,411,345
We will therefore ask the independent Migration Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the government about how the visa system can become better aligned with our modern industrial strategy.,411,346
"We envisage that the committees advice will allow us to set aside significant numbers of visas for workers in strategically-important sectors, such as digital technology, without adding to net migration as a whole.",411,347
"However, skilled immigration should not be a way for government or business to avoid their obligations to improve the skills of the British workforce.",411,348
"So we will double the Immigration Skills Charge levied on companies employing migrant workers, to £2,000 a year by the end of the parliament,",601.2,349
using the revenue generated to invest in higher level skills training for workers in the UK.,411,350
The Conservative Party is the party of enterprise and of the entrepreneur.,402,352
We understand that small businesses are the wellspring of growth.,402,353
"They form a key part of British life, valued for their contribution to every community across the country.",402,354
"We will continue to support small businesses through business rate relief and low taxation,",402,355
and by reducing the bureaucracy and regulation that prevents small businesses from flourishing.,402,356
"As part of broader reforms to the business energy market, we will consult on how to extend our safeguard tariff cap to micro-businesses.",402,357
"Central government must play a role in supporting SMEs: across all government departments, we will ensure that per cent of central government purchasing will come from SMEs by the end of the parliament.",402,358
"As part of our modern industrial strategy, we will explore how government can do even more to support innovation by small and start-up firms.",402,359
"We also recognise that government can improve the general business environment for SMEs, so we will use our buying power to ensure that big contractors comply with the Prompt Payment Code both on government contracts and in their work with others.",402,360
"If they do not do so, they will lose the right to bid for government contracts.",402,361
Our modern industrial strategy is not about planning the economy.,411,363
"It is about helping old industries find prosperous new life and unlock future opportunities, and new industries to grow.",411,364
Some industries have a great history.,601.1,365
We believe they can have a great future too.,601.1,366
"We have already demonstrated that in advanced manufacturing, such as aero and automotive engineering, we can lead the world.",411,367
We will continue to support these key industries so that they can grow further.,411,368
"We want to replicate that success in other sectors  like shipbuilding where, for the first time in decades, there is the prospect of a renaissance.",411,369
"We will take forward Sir John Parkers review of shipbuilding, helping our shipyards modernise and collaborate.",411,370
"We want to see shipbuilding growing on the Clyde and on the Forth, in Belfast and in Barrow, and in the north-east and south of England.",411,371
"Other industries, like the oil and gas sector, are transforming.",411,372
The North Sea has provided more than £300 billion in tax revenue to the UK economy and supports thousands of highly-skilled jobs across Britain.,411,373
"We will ensure that the sector continues to play a critical role in our economy and domestic energy supply, supporting further investment in the UKs natural resources.",411,374
We will continue to support the industry and build on the unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector.,411,375
"While there are very significant reserves still in the North Sea, it is expected to be the first major oil and gas basin in the world to decommission fully, and we will take advantage of that to support the development of a world-leading decommissioning industry.",411,376
We will work with the industry to create a multi-use yard and the UKs first ultra-deep water port to support this industry.,411,377
Other industries are already highly successful.,411,378
"Life sciences, for example, employs 175,000 people and many of the worlds top medicines have been developed in the UK.",411,379
"We will continue to support research into the diagnosis and treatment of rare cancers and other diseases, including Genomics Englands work in decoding 100,000 genomes.",411,380
"This, together with the development of stronger research links with the NHS, can help scientists and doctors design more effective and personalised treatments, and help maintain our position as the European hub for life sciences.",411,381
A successful industrial strategy requires competitive and affordable energy costs.,403,383
"We want to make sure that the cost of energy in Britain is internationally competitive, both for businesses and households.",401,384
"We will therefore commission an independent review into the Cost of Energy, which will be asked to make recommendations as to how we can ensure UK energy costs are as low as possible,",412,385
while ensuring a reliable supply and allowing us to meet our 2050 carbon reduction objective.,416.2,386
"Our ambition is that the UK should have the lowest energy costs in Europe, both for households and businesses.",412,387
"So as we upgrade our energy infrastructure, we will do it in an affordable way, consistent with that ambition.",411,388
"And because for British companies, an energy-efficient business is a more competitive business, we will establish an industrial energy efficiency scheme to help large companies install measures to cut their energy use and their bills.",402,389
"We want to see a diverse range of sources for Britains energy production, because a diverse energy economy is the best way to stimulate innovation,",411,391
and also to ensure that we are getting the right generation in the right place.,411,392
"For instance, while we do not believe that more large-scale onshore wind power is right for England, we will maintain our position as a global leader in offshore wind and support the development of wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland, where they will directly benefit local communities.",411,393
"Above all, we believe that energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives.",411,394
"So, after we have left the European Union, we will form our energy policy based not on the way energy is generated but on the ends we desire  reliable and affordable energy,",411,395
seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents,411,396
and meeting our global commitments on climate change.,501,397
The discovery and extraction of shale gas in the United States has been a revolution.,411,399
"Gas prices have fallen, driving growth in the American economy and pushing down prices for consumers.",411,400
The US has become less reliant on imported foreign energy and is more secure as a result.,411,401
"And because shale is cleaner than coal, it can also help reduce carbon emissions.",501,402
"We believe that shale energy has the potential to do the same thing in Britain, and could play a crucial role in rebalancing our economy.",411,403
We will therefore develop the shale industry in Britain.,411,404
"We will only be able to do so if we maintain public confidence in the process,",411,405
"if we uphold our rigorous environmental protections,",501,406
and if we ensure the proceeds of the wealth generated by shale energy are shared with the communities affected.,416.2,407
We will legislate to change planning law for shale applications.,411,408
"Non-fracking drilling will be treated as permitted development,",411,409
"expert planning functions will be established to support local councils,",411,410
"and, when necessary, major shale planning decisions will be made the responsibility of the National Planning Regime.",411,411
"We will set up a new Shale Environmental Regulator, which will assume the relevant functions of the Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.",411,412
"This will provide clear governance and accountability,",411,413
"become a source of expertise,",411,414
and allow decisions to be made fairly but swiftly.,411,415
"Finally, we will change the proposed Shale Wealth Fund so a greater percentage of the tax revenues from shale gas directly benefit the communities that host the extraction sites.",416.2,416
"Where communities decide that it is right for them, we will allow payments to be made directly to local people themselves.",416.2,417
A significant share of the remaining tax revenues will be invested for the benefit of the country at large.,503,418
"We are working through one of the largest-ever investment programmes in our roads and railways, putting some £40 billion into transport improvements across the United Kingdom over the rest of this decade.",411,420
"We are investing to reduce travel time and cost, increase capacity and attract investment here in the UK.",411,421
"We will continue our programme of strategic national investments, including High Speed 2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and the expansion of Heathrow Airport",411,422
 and we will ensure that these great projects do as much as possible to develop the skills and careers of British workers.,701,423
"We will continue to develop the strategic road network, providing extra lanes on our motorways and improving key routes",411,424
whilst also paying attention to parts of the country left behind because of poor transport connections.,411,425
We will continue to invest in roads to fix pinch points,411,426
and open up opportunities for new housing and local growth.,411,427
Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use.,411,428
We want almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050  and will invest £600 million by 2020 to help achieve it.,411,429
"We will invest in more low-emission buses,",411,430
as well as supporting audio-visual displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for rural areas poorly served by public transport.,411,431
"We will focus on creating extra capacity on the railways, which will ease overcrowding, bring new lines and stations, and improve existing routes  including for freight.",411,432
"We will increase services on our main lines and commuter routes,",411,433
and launch new services to places which are poorly served or host major new housing projects.,411,434
We will continue to support local authorities to expand cycle networks and upgrade facilities for cyclists at railway stations.,411,435
We have seen welcome growth and civic renewal in some major cities.,411,438
"There remains, however, a far greater gap between the capital and other cities in the UK than in any other major developed country.",503,439
We see the opportunity to close this gap as the biggest prize in Britain today.,503,440
"It will be a great endeavour by government, business and civic society over many years.",411,441
We are determined to lead the way in the next parliament.,411,442
"First, we recognise the value of institutions to the vitality of towns and cities.",411,443
"As we explain in chapter two, it is why we are determined to move many of the functions of central government out to cities around Britain where possible",301,444
and to see our vast cultural assets reach people around our country too.,502,445
"It is also why we will support local growth through combined authorities, mayoralties and local enterprise partnerships.",301,446
"We will make each partnership and combined authority responsible for co-ordinating their own local industrial strategy in alignment with our national industrial strategy, bringing together local businesses, political and public sector leaders to drive growth and economic regeneration.",410,447
We will wherever possible deliver growth funding through these organisations.,301,448
We will give local enterprise partnerships greater weight by backing them in law.,301,449
"Our institutions of education, old and new, will be critical to spreading success.",411,450
It is why we will back new scientific and technical institutions.,411,451
"It is why we want to see universities make their full contribution to their local community and economy, sponsoring local schools and being creative about how they can open up opportunities for local people, especially those from ordinary working backgrounds.",506,452
Our towns and cities excel when they have vibrant cultural life.,502,453
Britains arts and culture are world-beating and are at the heart of the regeneration of much of modern Britain.,502,454
"We will continue our strong support for the arts,",502,455
and ensure more of that support is based outside London.,502,456
We will maintain free entry to the permanent collections of our major national museums and galleries.,502,457
We will introduce a new cultural development fund to use cultural investment to turn around communities.,502,458
"We will hold a Great Exhibition of the North in 2018, to celebrate amazing achievements in innovation, the arts and engineering.",502,459
We will support a UK city in making a bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games.,502,460
"And in this 70th Anniversary Year of the Edinburgh Festival we will support the development of the new Edinburgh Concert Hall, reaffirming Edinburgh as the UKs leading festival city and a cultural beacon around the globe.",502,461
"Our towns and cities should be healthy, well-designed and well-tended places.",502,462
We will take action against poor air quality in urban areas.,501,463
"In addition to the 11 million trees we are planting across our nation, we will ensure that 1 million more are planted in our towns and cities,",501,464
and place new duties on councils to consult when they wish to cut down street trees.,501,465
"We will encourage the very best practice in the design of buildings and public spaces, including a review of the design of government buildings, to ensure that when the state builds, it makes a positive contribution to a local area.",411,466
"We will do more to reduce litter, including by supporting comprehensive rubbish collection and recycling, supporting better packaging, taking new powers to force councils to remove roadside litter and prosecuting offenders.",501,467
"We will do more to improve the quality of road surfaces, filling potholes  especially in residential areas",411,468
 and reducing road noise.,416.2,469
"We will bring sustainable growth to the rural economy and boost our rural areas, so that people who live in the countryside have the same opportunities as those who live in our towns and cities.",703.1,471
We have huge ambitions for our farming industry:,703.1,472
"we are determined to grow more, sell more and export more great British food.",703.1,473
We want to provide stability to farmers as we leave the EU and set up new frameworks for supporting food production and stewardship of the countryside.,703.1,474
So we will continue to commit the same cash total in funds for farm support until the end of the parliament.,703.1,475
"We will work with farmers, food producers and environmental experts across Britain and with the devolved administrations to devise a new agri-environment system, to be introduced in the following parliament.",703.1,476
Our countryside and rural communities have been moulded by generations of farmers.,703.1,477
"We will help Natural England to expand their provision of technical expertise to farmers to deliver environmental improvements on a landscape scale, from enriching soil fertility to planting hedgerows and building dry stone walls.",501,478
"We will deliver on our commitment to improve natural flood management, such as improving the quality of water courses to protect against soil erosion and damage to vulnerable habitats and communities.",501,479
"We will continue to ensure that public forests and woodland are kept in trust for the nation,",501,480
and provide stronger protections for our ancient woodland.,501,481
We will continue to take action to improve animal welfare.,501,482
We will implement our proposed reforms on pet sales and licensing,501,483
and will make CCTV recording in slaughterhouses mandatory.,501,484
"As we leave the European Union, we can take early steps to control the export of live farm animals for slaughter.",501,485
We will also take steps to enhance the provision of public services in rural areas.,703.1,486
"We will safeguard the post office network, to protect existing rural services",703.1,487
and work with the Post Office to extend the availability of business and banking services to families and small businesses in rural areas.,703.1,488
A third of all SMEs in rural areas use their post office weekly and our ambition is that all routine small business and consumer banking services should be available in rural post offices.,703.1,489
We will support pharmacies and village schools in rural areas.,703.1,490
"We will grant a free vote, on a government bill in government time, to give parliament the opportunity to decide the future of the Hunting Act.",502,491
"Finally, we pledge to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it.",501,492
That is why we shall produce a comprehensive 25 Year Environment Plan that will chart how we will improve our environment as we leave the European Union and take control of our environmental legislation again.,501,493
Decades of profound economic change have left their mark on coastal communities around Britain.,301,495
We will continue to work to ensure these communities enjoy the vitality and opportunity they deserve.,301,496
"In England, we will extend our successful Coastal Communities Fund to 2022, helping our seaside towns thrive.",301,497
"When we leave the European Union and its Common Fisheries Policy, we will be fully responsible for the access and management of the waters where we have historically exercised sovereign control.",110,498
"A new Conservative government will work with the fishing industry and with our world-class marine scientists, as well as the devolved administrations, to introduce a new regime for commercial fishing that will preserve and increase fish stocks",703.1,499
and help to ensure prosperity for a new generation of fishermen.,703.1,500
"To provide complete legal certainty to our neighbours and clarity during our negotiations with the European Union, we will withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention.",110,501
We will continue our work to conserve the marine environment off the coast of the United Kingdom.,501,502
"Theresa Mays Conservatives will deliver the best possible deal for Britain as we leave the European Union delivered by a smooth, orderly Brexit.",110,504
"A strong and stable Union, with no divisive Scottish referendum at this time.",302,505
"A United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund, taken from money coming back to the UK as we leave the EU, to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations.",302,506
"Global leadership on development, backed by spending 0.7 per cent of our national income with new rules to spend it more effectively.",107,507
"Strong defence, meeting our NATO target of at least 2 per cent of GDP",104,508
and increasing spending by at least half a per cent more than inflation every year.,104,509
"Security from crime and terrorism, backed by a new national infrastructure police force, a stronger response to white collar crime and our world-leading counter-terrorism strategy.",104,510
The United Kingdom is embarking upon another era in our centuries-old story.,110,511
We are leaving the European Union.,110,512
W e want to ensure our departure is smooth and orderly and to agree a deep and special partnership with the 27 remaining member states.,110,513
"In leaving the European Union, we have chosen a truly global role for Britain.",110,514
"To strike trade deals with old friends and new partners and take a leading position in the world to defend British interests, we must be strong and united.",107,515
"This begins with our determination to defend the integrity of the United Kingdom and to strengthen the Union, bringing the peoples of the United Kingdom together.",606.1,516
"We are a United Kingdom, one nation made of four  the most successful political union in modern history.",601.1,518
"Its very existence recognises the value of unity  England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales achieve less as two, three, or four, than as the United Kingdom together.",302,519
"This unity between our nations and peoples gives us the strength to change things for the better, for everyone, with a scale of ambition we simply could not possess alone.",302,520
The settlement governing these islands has changed profoundly in the last twenty years.,301,521
Significant decision-making have been devolved to the parliament in Scotland and assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland.,301,522
"Devolved administrations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast exercise greater powers than equivalent governments elsewhere in the democratic world.",301,523
"In England, we have given considerable powers to city mayors and combined authorities,",301,524
while local councils now have greater control of the taxes they collect.,301,525
"This positive evolution of our constitution has given a voice to people who felt distant from the centre of power, and responsibility to people for their own part of our great country.",301,526
"We will continue to work in partnership with the Scottish and Welsh governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, in a relationship underpinned by pooling and sharing resources through the Barnett Formula.",301,527
We will respect the devolution settlements: no decision-making that has been devolved will be taken back to Westminster.,301,528
"Indeed, we envisage that the powers of the devolved administrations will increase as we leave the EU.",301,529
"However, we can still do more for the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",302,530
The United Kingdom Government has in the past tended to devolve and forget.,302,531
This Conservative government will put that right.,302,532
We want the UK Government to be a force for good across the whole country.,302,533
"So we will be an active government, in every part of the UK.",302,534
"We will work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the new devolved authorities in England, for the benefit of all our people  but that will not be the limit of our actions in the four nations.",302,535
We are ambitious for everyone in Britain and will leave no-one behind in our efforts to spread opportunity and prosperity throughout the United Kingdom.,503,536
"This Conservative government has devolved more power to English local authorities, closer to local people, than any previous government in over a century:",301,538
"across England, newly elected mayors, combined authorities, local councils and local enterprise partnerships are being empowered to improve local growth and public services.",301,539
We will continue to give local government greater control over the money they raise and address concerns about the fairness of current funding distributions.,301,540
"With devolution now established in London and other parts of England, we will consolidate our approach, providing clarity across England on what devolution means for different administrations so all authorities operate in a common framework.",303,541
We will support those authorities that wish to combine to serve their communities better.,303,542
"For combined authorities that are based around our great cities, we will continue to support the adoption of elected mayors,",303,543
but we will not support them for the rural counties.,303,544
"The Scottish Parliament has become the most powerful parliament of its kind in the world, with extensive powers over taxation and welfare.",301,546
"It was the Conservative and Unionist Party that delivered the 2012 and 2016 Scotland Acts,",305.1,547
and only the Conservative and Unionist Party can deliver further powers and the best possible deal for Scotland as we leave the European Union.,301,548
The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union but some would disrupt our attempts to get the best deal for Scotland and the United Kingdom with calls for a divisive referendum that the people of Scotland do not want.,301,549
We have been very clear that now is not the time for another referendum on independence.,301,550
"In order for a referendum to be fair, legal and decisive, it cannot take place until the Brexit process has played out",202.4,551
and it should not take place unless there is public consent for it to happen.,606.1,552
"This is a time to pull together, not apart.",606.1,553
Scotlands economic growth has lagged behind the rest of the United Kingdom in recent years.,410,554
The Scottish Government has the tools to drive economic growth in Scotland but we take seriously our duty to secure prosperity for the whole of the United Kingdom.,410,555
"We will, therefore, take concerted action to help secure the long-term sustainability of the Scottish economy.",410,556
Scotland and Scottish industries will be central to our industrial strategy.,411,557
We will continue our investment in capital and infrastructure projects in Scotland.,411,558
"Building on the City and Growth deals we have signed across Scotland, we will bring forward a Borderlands Growth Deal, including all councils on both sides of the border, to help secure prosperity in southern Scotland.",410,559
We will protect the interests of Scottish farmers and fishermen as we design our new UK farming and fisheries policy.,703.1,560
"And as we develop our new trade policies, we will pay particular attention to using the United Kingdoms muscle to promote Scottish exports around the world.",407,561
"The Conservative Party has a proud record of promoting Welsh culture,",607.1,563
helping economic growth,410,564
and supporting devolution in Wales.,301,565
"The 2017 Wales Act, passed by a Conservative government, transfers significant new powers to the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government.",301,566
"Wales plays a crucial role in our modern industrial strategy,",411,567
in the promotion of growing industries in Wales,411,568
and in the additional powers handed to Welsh local authorities and businesses to promote local growth.,301,569

and our investment in improved infrastructure will help Welsh companies benefit even more from the UK single market than they do now.,411,571

We will protect the interest of Welsh farmers as we design our new UK farming policy,703.1,578
and work with the devolved administrations to ensure the strength of the Welsh brand is maintained.,301,579
"We will continue to support S4C as a part of a UK broadcasting structure and in its key role promoting the Welsh language, which a Conservative government first protected.",301,580
Our steadfast belief remains that Northern Irelands future is best served within a stronger United Kingdom.,601.1,582
"Our commitment to the 1998 Belfast Agreement and its successors, together with the institutions they establish, is undiminished.",202.1,583
"The next Conservative government will therefore work to re-establish a strong, stable and inclusive executive at the earliest opportunity.",305.3,584
We will uphold the essential principle that Northern Irelands future should only ever be determined by democracy and consent.,202.1,585
"A Conservative government will work closely with an incoming executive to strengthen the economy even further,",410,586
"to improve productivity,",410,587
reduce public sector dependency,401,588
and promote Northern Ireland as a location for inward investment.,410,589
We remain committed to the devolution of Corporation Tax powers subject to the executive demonstrating fiscal stability.,301,590
As we leave the European Union we recognise Northern Irelands unique circumstances and will seek to ensure that Northern Irelands interests are protected.,110,591
"While the number of terror attacks from dissident republican terrorists has fallen from forty in 2010 to four in 2016, the threat they pose remains severe and the need for vigilance paramount.",104,592
"We will continue to confront and combat those who use violence, threats and intimidation, providing the fullest possible support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other agencies in their work to keep the public safe and secure.",104,593
A Conservative government will continue to work for the full implementation of the 2014 Stormont House and 2015 Fresh Start Agreements.,301,594
"This includes new bodies for addressing the legacy of the past in fair, balanced and proportionate ways which do not unfairly focus on former members of the Armed Forces and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.",601.1,595
The immense contribution of the security forces during the troubles should never be forgotten.,601.1,596
We will reject any attempts to rewrite history which seek to justify or legitimise terrorism.,601.1,597
"For too long, power in Britain has been centred in London.",301,599
This means opportunity has centred in London too.,503,600
It is time major cities around Britain shared in the government of the United Kingdom.,301,601
"For our civil service and major cultural bodies to claim to be UK institutions, they need to represent and be present across our whole United Kingdom.",301,602
"It is also wrong that while some of our major cultural institutions have made efforts to gain a presence across the UK, others have not.",502,603
We will put this right.,301,604
"Starting with the UK Governments arms-length bodies, we will start moving significant numbers of UK Government civil servants and other public servants out of London and the south-east to cities around the UK.",301,605
"We will ensure that senior posts move too, so that operational headquarters as well as administrative functions are centred not in London but around Britain.",301,606
"And we will do so in a way that encourages the development of new clusters of public services, private businesses and, where appropriate, universities.",301,607
We will proceed on the same basis with the arts and cultural organisations that give our United Kingdom such strength.,502,608
"Channel will remain publicly owned and will be relocated out of London,",502,609
and we will work with the nations most eminent museums and galleries to ensure their works and expertise are shared across the country.,502,610
We believe in one nation  in helping every part of our country share in the prosperity and opportunity of our great United Kingdom.,503,612
Yet there is much to do.,503,613
Current EU-wide structural funding was designed to tackle disparities but it is expensive to administer and poorly targeted.,110,614
"As we leave the European Union, we must look at how we can better reduce and eliminate these inequalities.",503,615
"We will use the structural fund money that comes back to the UK following Brexit to create a United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund, specifically designed to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations.",503,616
"The money that is spent will help deliver sustainable, inclusive growth based on our modern industrial strategy.",416.2,617
"We will consult widely on the design of the fund, including with the devolved administrations, local authorities, businesses and public bodies.",202.1,618
"The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will be cheap to administer,",303,619
low in bureaucracy,303,620
and targeted where it is needed most.,303,621
"Following the historic referendum on 23rd June 2016, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.",110,623
"Only the Conservative Party, under Theresa Mays strong and stable leadership, can negotiate the best possible deal for our country.",305.2,624
"In her Lancaster House Speech, the prime minister laid out the twelve principles she intends to follow in seeking a new deep and special partnership with the European Union.",108,625
"We have explained our approach in the White Paper on the United Kingdoms Exit from, and a new relationship with, the European Union, during the passage of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act, in the prime ministers letter to the president of the European Council invoking Article 50, and in the Great Repeal Bill White Paper.",110,626
We want to agree a deep and special partnership with the European Union.,108,627
This partnership will benefit both the European Union and the United Kingdom:,108,628
"while we are leaving the European Union, we are not leaving Europe, and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.",108,629
"The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on both sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK.",110,630
But we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed to getting the best deal for Britain.,110,631
"We will make sure we have certainty and clarity over our future,",305.1,632
"control of our own laws,",202.1,633
"and a more unified, strengthened United Kingdom.",601.1,634
We will control immigration,601.2,635
and secure the entitlements of EU nationals in Britain and British nationals in the EU.,108,636
We will maintain the Common Travel Area,108,637
"and maintain as frictionless a border as possible for people, goods and services between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.",108,638
Workers rights conferred on British citizens from our membership of the EU will remain.,701,639
"We will pursue free trade with European markets,",407,640
and secure new trade agreements with other countries.,407,641
"We want to work together in the fight against crime and terrorism,",605.1,642
collaborate in science and innovation,411,643
" and secure a smooth, orderly Brexit.",110,644
"And we will protect the democratic freedom of the people of Gibraltar and our overseas territories to remain British, for as long as that is their wish.",601.1,645
The final agreement will be subject to a vote in both houses of parliament.,202.1,646
"As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union but we will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement.",407,647
"There may be specific European programmes in which we might want to participate and if so, it will be reasonable that we make a contribution.",108,648
"We will determine a fair settlement of the UKs rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the UKs continuing partnership with the EU.",110,649
"The principle, however, is clear: the days of Britain making vast annual contributions to the European Union will end.",110,650
"We want fair, orderly negotiations, minimising disruption and giving as much certainty as possible  so both sides benefit.",110,651
"We believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within the two years allowed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.",110,652
We will enact a Great Repeal Bill.,110,654
"Our laws will be made in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, and interpreted by judges across the United Kingdom, not in Luxembourg.",110,655
"The bill will convert EU law into UK law, allowing businesses and individuals to go about life knowing that the rules have not changed overnight.",202.1,656
This approach means that the rights of workers and protections given to consumers and the environment by EU law will continue to be available in UK law at the point at which we leave the EU.,202.1,657
"The bill will also create the necessary powers to correct the laws that do not operate appropriately once we have left the EU, so our legal system can continue to function correctly outside the EU.",202.1,658
"Once EU law has been converted into domestic law, parliament will be able to pass legislation to amend, repeal or improve any piece of EU law it chooses, as will the devolved legislatures, where they have the power to do so.",202.1,659
"As powers return from the EU, we will be able to determine the level best placed to take decisions on these issues, ensuring that power sits closer to the people of the United Kingdom than ever before.",301,660
We expect that the outcome will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration,301,661
but we must also ensure that as we leave the EU no new barriers to living,201.1,662
and doing business within our own union are created.,402,663
"In some areas, this will require common UK frameworks.",302,664
"We will work closely with the devolved administrations to deliver an approach that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and reflects the needs and individual circumstances of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",202.1,665
"As well as the Great Repeal Bill, we will bring forward a number of additional bills to ensure that when we have left the EU there is a clear statutory basis for United Kingdom authorities to exercise powers that are currently exercised through EU law and institutions.",202.1,666
We will not bring the European Unions Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law.,110,667
We will not repeal or replace the Human Rights Act while the process of Brexit is underway but we will consider our human rights legal framework when the process of leaving the EU concludes.,201.2,668
We will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights for the duration of the next parliament.,201.2,669
The United Kingdom is a global nation.,107,671
Our history is a global history; our future must be global too.,107,672
"We believe Britain should play an active, leading role in the world.",107,673

"We will lead a global effort to close down online spaces for those who abuse children, incite violence or propagate hate speech.",605.1,697
We shall lead the world in the hard work to end extreme child poverty,107,698

"The security andprosperityofthe UnitedKingdomisbuiltonthe internationalinstitutions that we helped to found and will continue to help maintain: the United Nations and the UN Security Council, NATO  the cornerstone of our defence, the Commonwealth, the G20, G7 and the World Trade Organization.",107,702
We will continue to give strong support to an international order in which rules govern state conduct;,107,703
in our own behaviour we will support this system and apply it in a principled way.,107,704
"We shall continue to seek to reform multilateral institutions, especially in the way they distribute development funds, so that money is used to greatest effect to protect and help the worlds most vulnerable people.",107,705
"Alongside our proposed deep and special partnership with the European Union, we will maintain the historical, cultural and economic ties that link us to our old friends and allies around the globe.",107,707

"It protects our interests: by building a safer, healthier, more prosperous world, we can protect our own people from disease, conflict and instability.",107,731
"This is the right ambition for a country with a global outlook, so we will maintain the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on assistance to developing nations and international emergencies.",107,732

"We do not believe that international definitions of development assistance always help in determining how money should be spent, on whom and for what purpose.",107,742
So we will work with like-minded countries to change the rules so that they are updated and better reflect the breadth of our assistance around the world.,107,743
"If that does not work, we will change the law to allow us to use a better definition of development spending, while continuing to meet our 0.7 per cent target.",107,744
We will ensure Britain remains a place of sanctuary for refugees and asylum seekers.,201.2,746

"The laws that we make form the basis of judgments in our courts, which are respected around the world.",202.1,809
This unequalled democracy and legal system is our greatest national inheritance.,202.1,810
"However, collective faith in our democratic institutions and our justice system has declined in the past two decades.",202.1,811
"It is the purpose of this Conservative Party, in responding to the historic vote on our membership of the European Union, to re-establish faith in our democracy, and in our democratic and legal institutions.",202.1,812

We will ensure that victims of crime are supported at every stage of the criminal justice system.,605.1,858
"We will enshrine victims entitlements in law, making clear what level of service they should expect from the police, courts and criminal justice system.",605.1,859
We will ensure that child victims and victims of sexual violence are able to be cross-examined before their trial without the distress of having to appear in court.,605.1,860
Publicly-funded advocates will have specialist training in handling victims before taking on serious sexual offences cases.,605.1,861
"To ensure that the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families over the last twenty years is not repeated, we will introduce an independent public advocate, who will act for bereaved families after a public disaster and support them at public inquests.",605.1,862
We will extend the scope of the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme so a wider range of sentences can be challenged.,605.1,863
"And we will push forward with our plan for tackling hate crime committed on the basis of religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.",605.1,864
"We will help Britains world-leading police forces and prosecutorial services to fight crime,",605.1,866
protect the public,605.1,867
and provide security for businesses.,605.1,868
"We will create a national infrastructure police force, bringing together the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the Ministry of Defence Police and the British Transport Police to improve the protection of critical infrastructure such as nuclear sites, railways and the strategic road network.",605.1,869
"We will strengthen Britains response to white collar crime by incorporating the Serious Fraud Office into the National Crime Agency, improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime.",605.1,870
"We will extend direct entry into the police, including at chief officer level.",605.1,871
We will continue to invest in our world-leading security services,104,872
and maintain and develop our counterterrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad.,104,873
"And we will bolster the response to cyber threats on private businesses, public services, critical national infrastructure, and individuals, working with the National Cyber Security Centre to prevent attacks wherever possible and with the police and international law enforcement agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.",104,874
We will widen the role of police and crime commissioners to help them cut crime for their local communities.,605.1,875
"We will ensure that commissioners sit on local health and wellbeing boards, enabling better co-ordination of crime prevention with local drug and alcohol and mental health services.",605.1,876
"We will build on the Policing and Crime Act, which introduced better co-ordination of policing and fire and rescue services, with greater devolution of criminal justice responsibility and budgets to local commissioners.",605.1,877
"Prisons should be places of reform and rehabilitation, but we should always remember that incarceration is punishment for people who commit serious crimes.",605.1,879
The £15 billion annual cost to society of reoffending shows we have so much more to do to make the penal system work better.,605.1,880
"Prisons must become places of safety, discipline and hard work, places where people are helped to turn their lives around.",605.1,881
"They should help prisoners learn English, maths and the work skills they need to get a job when they leave prison,",605.2,882
whilst providing the help prisoners require to come off drugs and deal with mental health problems.,605.2,883
"We will invest over £1 billion to modernise the prison estate, replacing the most dilapidated prisons and creating 10,000 modern prison places.",605.1,884
"We will reform the entry requirements, training, management and career paths of prison officers.",605.1,885
"We will create a new legal framework for prisons, strengthening the inspectorate and ombudsman to provide sharper external scrutiny.",605.1,886
Community punishments do not do enough to prevent crime and break the cycle of persistent offending.,605.1,887
"So we will create a national community sentencing framework that punishes offenders and focuses on the measures that have a better chance of turning people around and preventing crime, such as curfews and orders that tackle drug and alcohol abuse.",605.1,888
We will introduce dedicated provision for women offenders.,706,889
"Theresa Mays Conservatives will deliver · More good school places, ending the ban on selective schools",506,891
and asking universities and independent schools to help run state schools.,506,892
"World class technical education, underpinned by prestigious new institutes of technology with the freedoms that make our universities great.",411,893
"A government unafraid to confront the burning injustices of the gender pay gap,",503,894
"racial disparity,",503,895
the stigma of mental health,503,896
and disability discrimination.,503,897
Protections for victims of domestic abuse in law through a new landmark Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill.,605.1,898
Fairer markets for consumers,403,899
"and action on the cost of living, including a safeguard tariff cap to protect energy customers from unacceptable rises.",412,900
"Controlled, sustainable migration, with net migration down to the tens of thousands.",601.2,901
We have done much in recent years to break down longstanding divisions in our country.,503,902
Yet some social injustices endure.,503,903
If you are at a state school you are less likely to reach the top professions than if you are educated privately.,503,904
"If you are a white, working-class boy, you are less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university.",503,905
"If you are black, you are treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you are white.",503,906
"If you are born poor, you will die on average nine years earlier than others.",503,907
"If you are a woman, you will earn less than a man.",503,908
"If you suffer from mental health problems, there is not enough help at hand.",504,909
"These are burning injustices that damage the unity of our country, and we will address them.",503,910
"The truth is that if we are to make Britain the worlds Great Meritocracy, we also need to do much more to support millions of people who live in ordinary, working families.",701,911
Because life is often much harder for these families than many in positions of power seem to realise.,701,912
"They might have a job, but not always job security;",701,913
"they might be homeowners, but they worry about paying the mortgage and wonder if their children will be able to afford a home of their own;",701,914
"they can just about manage, but worry about the cost of living and getting their children into a good school.",701,915
They deserve a government that is on their side.,701,916
"The greatest injustice in Britain today is that your life is still largely determined not by your efforts and talents but by where you come from, who your parents are and what schools you attend.",503,918
This is wrong.,503,919
We want to make Britain the worlds Great Meritocracy:,503,920
"a country where everyone has a fair chance to go as far as their talent and their hard work will allow,",503,921
where advantage is based on merit not privilege.,503,922
"To succeed, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from, can have a world-class education.",506,923
"We are proud of our reforms to education, which are giving millions of children a better start in life than they could have expected a decade ago.",506,925
"Thanks to our school reforms  such as the establishment of free schools and academies, and changes to ensure a rigorous curriculum  there are more good and outstanding schools today than ever before.",506,926
There are now more than 1.8 million more children in schools rated good and outstanding than in 2010.,506,927
The proportion of pupils taking core academic subjects at GCSE has almost doubled.,506,928
There remains a long way to go.,506,929
"For too many children, a good school remains out of reach.",506,930
There are still 1 million children in primary and secondary schools rated by Ofsted as requires improvement or inadequate.,506,931
"If schools across the Midlands and north of England had the same average standards as those in the south, nearly 200,000 more children would be attending good schools.",506,932
We need to give every child in our country the best possible education if we are to provide them with the best opportunities in the world.,506,933
To achieve that ambition we will have to go further in reforming our education system.,506,934
"So we will continue with our programme of free schools, building at least a hundred new free schools a year.",506,935
We will prohibit councils from creating any new places in schools that have been rated either inadequate or requires improvement by Ofsted.,506,936
We will make it a condition for universities hoping to charge maximum tuition fees to become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding of free schools.,506,937
We will introduce new funding arrangements so we can open a specialist maths school in every major city in England.,506,938
"We will replace the unfair and ineffective inclusivity rules that prevent the establishment of new Roman Catholic schools, instead requiring new faith schools to prove that parents of other faiths and none would be prepared to send their children to that school.",506,939
"We will work with the Independent Schools Council to ensure that at least 100 leading independent schools become involved in academy sponsorship or the founding of free schools in the state system, keeping open the option of changing the tax status of independent schools if progress is not made.",506,940
"We will lift the ban on the establishment of selective schools, subject to conditions, such as allowing pupils to join at other ages as well as eleven.",506,941
"Contrary to what some people allege, official research shows that slightly more children from ordinary, working class families attend selective schools as a percentage of the school intake compared to nonselective schools.",503,942
"While the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils stands at 25 per cent across the country, at selective schools it falls to almost zero.",506,943
"These changes will have a great effect, but alone they cannot overcome the unfairness of selection by house price, where ordinary, working class families find it difficult to access the best schools because they cannot afford to live in the catchment area.",503,944
We will therefore conduct a review of school admissions policy.,503,945
We will be clear at the outset that we will never introduce a mandatory lottery-based school admissions policy.,503,946
Our reforms to what is taught in schools have been profound.,506,948
We have addressed grade inflation and poor standards and developed a world-class curriculum.,506,949
"This has meant considerable change for pupils, teachers and schools.",506,950
"So now we will help them consolidate those gains, starting with the early building blocks of learning.",506,951
A Conservative government will strengthen the teaching of literacy and numeracy in the early years so that all pupils  regardless of background  get the best possible start in life.,506,952
We will build on the success of the phonics screening test.,506,953
We will expect every 11-yearold to know their times tables off by heart.,506,954
"To maintain progress as children go through secondary school, we will improve schools accountability at key stage.",506,955
"We will expect 75 per cent of pupils to have been entered for the EBacc combination of GCSEs by the end of the next parliament, with 90 per cent of pupils studying this combination of academic GCSEs by 2025.",506,956
"We will ensure all children have access to an academic, knowledge-rich curriculum.",506,957
"We will introduce a curriculum fund to encourage Britains leading cultural and scientific institutions, like the British Museum and others to help develop knowledge-rich materials for our schools,",506,958
"and we will ensure that assessments at the end of primary school draw from a rich knowledge base,",506,959
and reduce teaching to the test.,506,960
We will consider how Ofsted can give parents more information on what their children are being taught.,506,961
"We want great people to become teachers, teach in our most challenging schools and stay there.",506,963
We will continue to provide bursaries to attract top graduates into teaching.,506,964
"To help new teachers remain in the profession, we will offer forgiveness on student loan repayments while they are teaching and bring in dedicated support to help them throughout their careers.",506,965
"We will provide greater support for teachers in the preparation of lessons and marking, including through the use of technology,",506,966
and we will bear down on unnecessary paperwork and the burden of Ofsted inspections.,506,967
"We will create a single jobs portal, like NHS Jobs, for schools to advertise vacancies in order to reduce costs and help them find the best teachers.",506,968
The way funding is distributed to schools in England is not fair.,506,970
"Across the country, children with the same needs and expectations receive markedly different rates of funding for their school place.",506,971
We have begun to correct this and in the next parliament we will make funding fairer still.,506,972
"We appreciate that it is hard for schools receiving a higher level of funding to make cuts in order to pay for increases elsewhere, so while we will make funding fairer over the course of the parliament, we will make sure that no school has its budget cut as a result of the new formula.",506,973
"We will increase the overall schools budget by £4 billion by 2022, representing more than a real terms increase for every year of the parliament.",506,974
We will continue to protect the Pupil Premium to support those who need it.,506,975
"In order to fund these commitments, we have taken an important decision.",505,976
We do not believe that giving school lunches to all children free of charge for the first three years of primary school  regardless of the income of their parents  is a sensible use of public money.,505,977
There is now good evidence that school breakfasts are at least as effective in helping children to make progress in school.,505,978
"So under a new Conservative government, schools in England will offer a free school breakfast to every child in every year of primary school, while children from low-income families will continue to receive free school lunches throughout their years in primary and secondary education.",505,979
"The savings made from this change will be added to the core schools budget, meaning that every penny saved will go towards childrens education.",506,980
"For too long in this country, technical excellence has not been valued as highly as academic success.",411,982
"We want British technical education to be as prestigious as our worldleading higher education system, and for technical education in this country to rival the best technical systems in the world.",411,983
"This will require bold reform of the funding, institutional and qualifications frameworks for technical education, in partnership with British industry.",411,984
"We have already introduced high quality apprenticeships that can reach to degree level and beyond for the 200,000 young people who choose to enter full-time vocational study after their GCSEs each year.",411,985
We now need to go further to improve technical education and offer young people a real choice between technical and academic routes at sixteen.,411,986
"We will start by replacing 13,000 existing technical qualifications with new qualifications, known as T-levels, across fifteen routes in subjects including construction, creative and design, digital, engineering and manufacturing, and health and science.",411,987
We will increase the number of teaching hours by fifty per cent to an average of 900 hours per year,411,988
and make sure that each student does a three-month work placement as part of their course.,411,989
And we will extend our reforms to the highest levels of technical qualification.,411,990
We will invest in further education colleges to make sure they have world-class equipment and facilities,411,991
and will create a new national programme to attract experienced industry professionals to work in FE colleges.,411,992
"We will establish new institutes of technology, backed by leading employers and linked to leading universities, in every major city in England.",411,993
"They will provide courses at degree level and above, specialising in technical disciplines, such as STEM,",411,994
whilst also providing higher-level apprenticeships and bespoke courses for employers.,411,995
"They will enjoy the freedoms that make our universities great, including eligibility for public funding for productivity and skills research, and access to loans and grants for their students.",411,996
They will be able to gain royal charter status and regius professorships in technical education.,411,997
"Above all, they will become anchor institutions for local, regional and national industry, providing sought-after skills to support the economy,",411,998
and developing their own local identity to make sure they can meet the skills needs of local employers.,411,999
"To ensure that further, technical and higher education institutions are treated fairly, we will also launch a major review of funding across tertiary education as a whole, looking at how we can ensure that students get access to financial support that offers value for money,",411,1000
is available across different routes,411,1001
and encourages the development of the skills we need as a country.,411,1002
We will put employers at the centre of these reforms.,411,1003
We will deal with local skills shortages,411,1004
and ensure that colleges deliver the skills required by local businesses through Skills Advisory Panels and Local Enterprise Partnerships working at a regional and local level.,411,1005
We will deliver our commitment to create 3 million apprenticeships for young people by 2020,411,1006
and in doing so we will drive up the quality of apprenticeships to ensure they deliver the skills employers need.,411,1007
"We will allow large firms to pass levy funds to small firms in their supply chain,",411,1008
and work with the business community to develop a new programme to allow larger firms to place apprentices in their supply chains.,411,1009
"We will explore teaching apprenticeships sponsored by major companies, especially in STEM subjects.",411,1010
"Lastly, we will make the system easier for young people taking technical and vocational routes.",411,1011
We will introduce a UCAS-style portal for technical education.,411,1012
We will introduce significantly discounted bus and train travel for apprentices to ensure that no young person is deterred from an apprenticeship due to travel costs.,503,1013
We will in the next parliament produce the best programme of learning and training for people in work and returning to work in the developed world.,411,1015
We will help all workers seeking to develop their skills in their existing jobs by introducing a new right to request leave for training for all employees.,411,1016
"Alongside this, we will help workers to stay in secure jobs as the economy changes by introducing a national retraining scheme.",701,1017
"Under the scheme, the costs of training will be met by the government, with companies able to gain access to the Apprenticeship Levy to support wage costs during the training period.",411,1018
We will break down the barriers to public sector workers taking on more qualified roles because of their prior educational attainment.,503,1019
"For instance, we will ensure that teaching assistants can become qualified teachers and healthcare assistants can become nurses via a degree apprenticeship route, in addition to other routes.",411,1020
"We will equip people with the digital skills they need now, and in the future, by introducing a right to lifelong learning in digital skills, just as we have done for literacy and numeracy.",411,1021
Employment is at a record high and we will continue to strive for full employment.,701,1023
"We will continue to run the welfare system in accordance with our belief that work is the best route out of poverty,",505,1024
"that work should always pay,",701,1025
and that the system should be fair both to the people in need of support and those who pay for it.,503,1026
"We have no plans for further radical welfare reform in this parliament and will continue the roll-out of Universal Credit, to ensure that it always pays to be in work.",504,1027
"We will also work to help those groups who have in the past found it difficult to get employment, by incentivising employers to take them on.",503,1028
"So for businesses employing former wards of the care system, someone with a disability, those with chronic mental health problems, those who have committed a crime but who have repaid their debt to society, and those who have been unemployed for over a year, we will offer a holiday on their employers National Insurance Contributions for a full year.",504,1029
"We will also provide targeted support for young people between the ages of 18 and 24 so that everyone, no matter what their start in life, is given the very best chance of getting into work.",503,1030
Britain is an open economy,401,1033
and a welcoming society,602.2,1034
and we will always ensure that our British businesses can recruit the brightest and best from around the world and Britains world-class universities can attract international students.,402,1035
"We also believe that immigration should be controlled and reduced, because when immigration is too fast and too high, it is difficult to build a cohesive society.",601.2,1036
"Thanks to Conservatives in government, there is now more control in the system.",601.2,1037
"The nature of the immigration we have  more skilled workers and university students, less abuse and fewer unskilled migrants  better suits the national interest.",601.2,1038
"But with annual net migration standing at 273,000, immigration to Britain is still too high.",601.2,1039
"It is our objective to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, by which we mean annual net migration in the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands we have seen over the last two decades.",601.2,1040
"We will, therefore, continue to bear down on immigration from outside the European Union.",601.2,1041
We will increase the earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor migrants for family visas.,601.2,1042
"We will toughen the visa requirements for students, to make sure that we maintain high standards.",601.2,1043
"We will expect students to leave the country at the end of their course, unless they meet new, higher requirements that allow them to work in Britain after their studies have concluded.",601.2,1044
Overseas students will remain in the immigration statistics  in line with international definitions  and within scope of the governments policy to reduce annual net migration.,601.2,1045
"Leaving the European Union means, for the first time in decades, that we will be able to control immigration from the European Union too.",601.2,1046
"We will therefore establish an immigration policy that allows us to reduce and control the number of people who come to Britain from the European Union,",601.2,1047
while still allowing us to attract the skilled workers our economy needs.,411,1048
"Britain is one of the worlds most successful multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious societies.",607.2,1050
"We are proud of our diversity, and the cultural and economic enrichment it brings.",607.2,1051
"The enjoyment and pride we take in our diversity should not cause us to ignore the fact that in too many parts of our country, we have communities that are divided, often along racial or religious lines.",608.1,1052
"To address this, we will bring forward a new integration strategy, which will seek to help people in more isolated communities to engage with the wider world,",608.1,1053
"help women in particular into the workplace,",706,1054
and teach more people to speak English.,608.2,1055
"We will work with schools to make sure that those with intakes from one predominant racial, cultural or religious background teach their students about pluralistic, British values",608.2,1056
and help them to get to know people with different ways of life.,608.2,1057
Our enjoyment of Britains diversity must not prevent us from confronting the menace of extremism.,605.1,1059
"Extremism, especially Islamist extremism, strips some British people, especially women, of the freedoms they should enjoy,",503,1060
undermines the cohesion of our society,606.1,1061
and can fuel violence.,605.1,1062
"To defeat extremism, we need to learn from how civil society and the state took on racism in the twentieth century.",606.1,1063
"We will consider what new criminal offences might need to be created, and what new aggravated offences might need to be established, to defeat the extremists.",605.1,1064
"We will support the public sector and civil society in identifying extremists,",605.1,1065
countering their messages,605.1,1066
"and promoting pluralistic, British values.",601.1,1067
"And we will establish a Commission for Countering Extremism to identify examples of extremism and expose them,",605.1,1068
"to support the public sector and civil society,",606.1,1069
and help the government to identify policies to defeat extremism,605.1,1070
and promote pluralistic values.,202.1,1071
"To make Britain the worlds Great Meritocracy, where your talent and hard work, not who you are or where you come from, determine your life chances, we must look beyond divisions in educational opportunity.",503,1073
"We must tackle the burning injustices that Theresa May identified on the steps of Downing Street last year: longstanding, entrenched injustices that affect people of different ethnicities, genders and those with disabilities and mental ill health.",503,1074
We will take measures to close the gender pay gap.,503,1076
We will require companies with more than 250 employees to publish more data on the pay gap between men and women.,503,1077
"We shall continue to work for parity in the number of public appointments going to women,",503,1078
and we shall push for an increase in the number of women sitting on boards of companies.,503,1079
We will take steps to improve take-up of shared parental leave,503,1080
and help companies provide more flexible work environments that help mothers and fathers to share parenting.,402,1081
We want to help those who have been caring for a child or children for a number of years or supporting an elderly relative.,503,1082
"For these people, returning to work can be daunting: things have moved on and people worry that their skills have been eroded.",503,1083
"We will address this, providing parents and carers with the confidence to return to work when and how they wish.",701,1084
So we will support companies to take on parents and carers returning to work after long periods of absence,402,1085
"and back similar schemes in the public sector, including the countrys biggest employer, our NHS.",402,1086
"Theresa Mays first act as prime minister was to order an unprecedented audit of racial disparity across public services, to reveal the outcomes experienced by people of different ethnicities.",503,1088
"That audit reports in July and a Conservative government will not hesitate to act on its findings, however uncomfortable they may be.",503,1089
"Alongside that assault on injustice, we will tackle those issues we already know about head on.",503,1090
"We will strengthen the enforcement of equalities law  so that private landlords and businesses who deny people a service on the basis of ethnicity, religion or gender are properly investigated and prosecuted.",503,1091
We will legislate to mandate changes in police practices if stop and search does not become more targeted and stop to arrest ratios do not improve.,503,1092
"We will reduce the disproportionate use of force against Black, Asian and ethnic minority people in prison, young offender institutions and secure mental health units",503,1093
and we will legislate here too if progress is not made.,503,1094
"We will launch a national campaign to increase the number of Black, Asian and ethnic minority organ donors to cut the long waiting times for patients from those groups and save more lives.",503,1095
We will also ask large employers to publish information on the pay gap for people from different ethnic backgrounds.,503,1096
It was Conservatives in government that gave parity of esteem to the treatment of mental health in the National Health Service.,504,1098
"We have backed this with a significant increase in funding: since 2010 we have increased spending on mental health each year to a record £11.4 billion in 2016/17, with a further investment of £1 billion by 20/21, so that we can deliver the mental health services people deserve.",504,1099
We will now build on this commitment.,504,1100
"First, we will address the need for better treatments across the whole spectrum of mental health conditions.",504,1101
"We will make the UK the leading research and technology economy in the world for mental health, bringing together public, private and charitable investment.",411,1102
"Improving treatment services will not be sufficient, however.",503,1103
We will also reform outdated laws to ensure that those with mental illness are treated fairly,504,1104
and employers fulfil their responsibilities effectively.,416.2,1105
The current Mental Health Act does not operate as it should:,504,1106
if you are put on a community treatment order it is very difficult to be discharged;,504,1107
sectioning is too often used to detain rather than treat;,504,1108
families information about their loved ones is severely curtailed,201.1,1109
 parents can be the last to learn that their son or daughter has been sectioned.,201.1,1110
"So we will introduce the first new Mental Health Bill for thirty-five years, putting parity of esteem at the heart of treatment.",504,1111
We will transform how mental health is regarded in the workplace.,701,1112
"We will amend health and safety regulations so that employers provide appropriate first aid training and needs assessment for mental health, as they currently do for risks to physical health,",504,1113
and extend Equalities Act protections against discrimination to mental health conditions that are episodic and fluctuating.,503,1114
"We will consider the findings of the Stevenson-Farmer Review into workplace mental health support, working with employers to encourage new products and incentives to improve the mental health and wellbeing support available to their employees.",701,1115
"And, as we did with Dementia Friends, we will train one million members of the public in basic mental health awareness and first aid to break the stigma of mental illness.",503,1116
"We will build on the proud Conservative record in supporting those with disabilities, including the landmark Disability Discrimination Act of 1995.",503,1118
"We want to see attitudes to disability shift as they have for race, gender and sexuality in recent years:",705,1119
it should be completely unacceptable for people with disabilities to be treated negatively.,705,1120
We will get 1 million more people with disabilities into employment over the next ten years.,705,1121
We will harness the opportunities of flexible working and the digital economy to generate jobs for those whose disabilities make traditional work difficult.,701,1122
We will give employers the advice and support they need to hire and retain disabled people and those with health conditions.,402,1123
"We will continue to ensure a sustainable welfare system, with help targeted at those who need it most.",504,1124
We will legislate to give unemployed disabled claimants or those with a health condition personalised and tailored employment support.,504,1125
"We believe that where you live, shop, go out, travel or park your car should not be determined by your disability.",503,1126
"So we will review disabled peoples access and amend regulations if necessary to improve disabled access to licensed premises, parking and housing.",705,1127
"We will work with providers of everyday essential services, like energy and telecoms, to reduce the extra costs that disability can incur.",705,1128
Conservatives in government have already acted to help victims of domestic violence to seek refuge.,605.1,1130
We can and should go further.,605.1,1131
We need the police to investigate allegations thoroughly and treat victims with the care they deserve.,605.1,1132
We need to bring to the justice system greater guidance and clarity about the impact of domestic violence and abuse on families.,605.1,1133
"And we need to understand and respond to the devastating and lifelong impact that domestic violence and abuse has on children, who carry the effects into adulthood.",605.1,1134
A Conservative government will bring forward a Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill in the next parliament to consolidate all civil and criminal prevention and protection orders,605.1,1135
and provide for a new aggravated offence if behaviour is directed at a child.,605.1,1136
There is currently no statutory definition of domestic violence and abuse.,605.1,1137
"We will therefore also legislate to enshrine a definition of domestic violence and abuse in law, providing the legal underpinning for everything in our new act.",605.1,1138
"This will enable us to work with victim support groups, experts and agencies to determine whether the current statutory definition is wide enough,",605.1,1139
"to help survivors understand more easily if they have a basis for a complaint,",605.1,1140
and to provide a more reliable basis for police forces to investigate and the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute.,605.1,1141
"We will create a domestic violence and abuse commissioner in law,",605.1,1142
"to stand up for victims and survivors,",605.1,1143
monitor the response to domestic violence and abuse,605.1,1144
and to hold the police and the criminal justice system to account.,605.1,1145
"And we will take action to support victims of domestic violence to leave abusive partners,",605.1,1146
reviewing the funding for refuges,706,1147
and ensuring that victims who have lifetime tenancies and flee violence are able to secure a new lifetime tenancy automatically.,605.1,1148
"Finally, we will continue to combat homelessness and rough sleeping including through full implementation of the Homelessness Reduction Act.",504,1150
Our aim will be to halve rough sleeping over the course of the parliament and eliminate it altogether by 2027.,504,1151
"To achieve this we will set up a new homelessness reduction taskforce that will focus on prevention and affordable housing,",504,1152
and we will pilot a Housing First approach to tackle rough sleeping.,504,1153
"Breaking down long-standing social divisions in our society means tackling everyday economic pressures that hold back ordinary, working families.",503,1155
Government can help with the cost of living by keeping tax as low as possible.,503,1156
As we set out in chapter one we want to reduce taxes on British businesses,402,1157
and working families.,603,1158
"But government can also help by making consumer markets work more fairly, and in doing so reducing the cost of the essentials that families have no choice but to buy.",403,1159
These costs make up a much larger share of working class household budgets than those of better-off households.,701,1160
Tackling living costs must mean making consumer markets work fairly.,403,1162
"Markets should work for consumers, as well as producers  with competition keeping prices low and encouraging new product development.",403,1163
"Poor information, complex pricing and exploitative behaviour prevents markets operating efficiently for the benefit of all.",403,1164
"As Conservatives, we believe in markets as the best means to bring about prosperity and innovation, but we should act firmly and fast when a market works against the interests of consumers.",403,1165
"Since 2010, we have capped the cost of credit for expensive payday lenders",403,1166
and will shortly ban letting agent fees.,403,1167
We will now go further to reform markets in the interests of consumers and reduce the cost of living.,403,1168
A Conservative government will strengthen the hand of regulators.,403,1169
We will strengthen the powers of consumer enforcement bodies to order fines against companies breaking consumer law and deliver redress for wronged parties,403,1170
. We will explore how to give consumers a voice in the regulation of business.,403,1171
"We will put the interest of vulnerable consumers first, including considering a duty on regulators to weigh up their needs.",403,1172
"We will investigate how switching sites can better serve competition, including by providing shoppers with information about quality of service and complaints.",403,1173
We will strengthen the hand of online consumers.,403,1174
"We will act to make terms and conditions clearer,",403,1175
"and end the abusive use of subscription services, including by making it clearer when free trials come to an end.",403,1176
We will also act in specific markets.,403,1177
A Conservative government will reform and modernise the home-buying process so it is more efficient and less costly.,403,1178
"We will crack down on unfair practices in leasehold, such as escalating ground rents.",403,1179
"We will also improve protections for those who rent, including by looking at how we increase security for good tenants and encouraging landlords to offer longer tenancies as standard.",403,1180
"We will make billing for telecoms customers fairer and easier to understand, including making clear when a mobile customer has paid off the price of their handset.",403,1181
We will consider a ban on companies cold calling people encouraging them to make false personal injury claims.,403,1182
We will take steps to tackle rogue private parking operators.,403,1183
We will reduce insurance costs for ordinary motorists by cracking down on exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims.,412,1184
"We will review rail ticketing, removing complexity and perverse pricing, and introduce a passenger ombudsman to stand up for the interests of rail users suffering a poor deal.",403,1185
We will work with train companies and their employees to agree minimum service levels during periods of industrial dispute ,405,1186
"and if we cannot find a voluntary agreement, we will legislate to make this mandatory.",702,1187
We will pay immediate attention to the retail energy market.,403,1189
Customers trust established brands and mistakenly assume their loyalty is rewarded.,403,1190
"Energy suppliers have long operated a two-tier market, where those constantly checking for the best deal can do well but others are punished for inactivity with higher prices.",403,1191
"Those hit worst are households with lower incomes,",701,1192
"people with lower qualifications,",701,1193
people who rent their home,403,1194
and the elderly.,706,1195
A Conservative government will act in their interests.,403,1196
"First, we will ensure that smart meters will be offered to every household and business by the end of 2020, giving people control over their energy bills that they have not had before.",411,1197
We will go further.,403,1198
We will introduce a safeguard tariff cap that will extend the price protection currently in place for some vulnerable customers to more customers on the poorest value tariffs.,412,1199
"We will maintain the competitive element of the retail energy market by supporting initiatives to make the switching process easier and more reliable,",403,1200
but the safeguard tariff cap will protect customers who do not switch against abusive price increases.,412,1201
"Alongside giving individuals greater control over their energy bills and protecting customers from unfair bills, we will help them to save energy.",416.2,1202
An energy efficient home is a more affordable and healthy home.,403,1203
"We will improve the energy efficiency of existing homes, especially for the least well off, by committing to upgrading all fuel poor homes to EPC Band C by 2030.",416.2,1204
We will also review requirements on new homes.,411,1205
"For some people, the cost of living can become too great.",503,1207
"Problem debt can be hard to escape and can compound family breakdown, worklessness, stress and mental health issues.",504,1208
"We will adopt a Breathing Space scheme, with the right safeguards to prevent abuse, so that someone in serious problem debt may apply for legal protection from further interest, charges and enforcement action for a period of up to six weeks.",403,1209
"Where appropriate, they will be offered a statutory repayment plan to help them pay back their debts in a manageable way.",403,1210
This will give eligible debtors time to seek advice and assistance to apply for a sustainable solution to their debt.,504,1211
"Theresa Mays Conservatives will deliver ·Sound public finances, built on fiscal credibility and a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade.",414,1213
Guaranteed annual increases in the state pension through a new Double Lock to be introduced in 2020.,504,1214
Dignity and protection in old age through the right long-term solution for elderly care.,706,1215
"Exceptional healthcare, whenever, wherever, delivered by an NHS with the money, buildings and people it needs.",504,1216
"Homes for all, including a new generation of fixed-term council housing linked to a new Right to Buy.",503,1217
"High-quality childcare for working families, supported by thousands of new nursery places a year.",701,1218
"No grandparent wants to see their grandchildren worse off than they were, yet that is precisely the fear many older people now have.",603,1219
"No son or daughter wants to see their parents poorly cared for or their hard-earned assets whitiled away, yet that is the reality for too many old people in care.",504,1220
We must admit that the solidarity that binds generations is under strain in our country.,606.1,1221
"We will restore the contract between the generations,",606.1,1222
providing older people with security against ill health,504,1223
while ensuring we maintain the promise of opportunity and prosperity for younger generations.,503,1224
"That contract includes our National Health Service, which is founded on the principle that those who have should help those who do not.",504,1225
"It is a system of solidarity to which we all contribute, not just to help us and our families when we are in need but to protect others in our community when they need help too.",606.1,1226
This not just expediency: we do it because the support we give each other ties us together.,606.1,1227
"This solidarity is a Conservative principle, growing out of family, community and nation  all things that Conservatives believe in and work to conserve.",606.1,1228
"At times, solidarity will require great generosity from one group to another  of younger working people to pay for the dignified old age of retired people, and of older people balancing what they receive with the needs of the younger generation.",606.1,1229
Our United Kingdom can seize enormous opportunities but only if we make decisions for the long term.,601.1,1230
"We trust the people of this country, who know that we face difficult choices",601.1,1231
 and demand the respect of politicians who should be honest about how those choices can be resolved.,305.1,1232
The greatest impact a government can have on future generations is the amount it chooses to borrow to pay for current spending.,414,1234
"Borrowing always means spending money you do not have; but government borrowing differs because the repayment falls to others  those who come later, including people not yet born.",414,1235
Conservatives believe in balancing the books and paying down debts  because it is wrong to pass to future generations a bill you cannot or will not pay yourself.,414,1236
The next Conservative government will continue the difficult but necessary work of restoring our public finances while still ensuring that we are investing for the future.,414,1237
"As we set out in chapter one, we will continue to aim for a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade, in line with the fiscal rules announced by the chancellor in his autumn statement last year.",414,1238
People are living longer.,706,1240
"This is a good thing, but we should not ignore the consequences.",706,1241
"As our society ages, the costs of caring for older generations  pensions, pensioner benefits, health and social care  rise; and these are borne by working people through their taxes.",706,1242
"As the relative number of younger people is falling, those costs increase, not just in total, but also for individuals.",706,1243
"So if we are to give older people the dignity we owe them and younger people the opportunities they deserve, we face difficult decisions.",706,1244
"A decade ago, pensions were in crisis and poverty blighted the retirement of many older people.",504,1246
It was wrong and it has been a Conservative government that has helped to put it right.,504,1247
"By introducing the Pensions Triple Lock and the new State Pension, we have lifted the incomes of millions of older people, reducing pensioner poverty to historically low levels.",504,1248
The Triple Lock has worked: it is now time to set pensions on an even course.,504,1249
"So we will keep our promise to maintain the Triple Lock until 2020, and when it expires we will introduce a new Double Lock, meaning that pensions will rise in line with the earnings that pay for them, or in line with inflation  whichever is highest.",504,1250
"We will also ensure that the state pension age reflects increases in life expectancy, while protecting each generation fairly.",504,1251
The state pension is the basic building block for income in retirement.,504,1252
"In addition to safeguarding the rising state pension, we will continue to support the successful expansion of auto-enrolled pensions, enabling more people to increase their retirement income with help from their employers and government;",504,1253
we will continue to extend auto-enrolment to small employers and make it available to the self-employed.,504,1254
"We will promote long-term savings and pensions products, including the Lifetime ISA, to encourage and incentivise more people to make provision for long-term needs, including a house purchase and retirement.",504,1255
"Our system of care for the elderly is not working for the hundreds of thousands currently not getting the dignified and careful attention they deserve,",504,1257
"nor for the people and organisations providing that care,",504,1258
nor is it sustainable for todays younger people who will potentially one day face care costs themselves.,504,1259
It is not fair that the quality of care you receive and how much you pay for it depends in large part on where you live and whether you own your own home.,503,1260
"Where others have failed to lead, we will act.",504,1261
"We have already taken immediate action, putting £2 billion into the social care system",504,1262
and allowing councils to raise more money for care themselves from Council Tax.,301,1263
We are now proposing medium and long-term solutions to put elderly care in our country on a strong and stable footing.,504,1264
"Under the current system, care costs deplete an individuals assets, including in some cases the family home, down to £23,250 or even less.",504,1265
These costs can be catastrophic for those with modest or medium wealth.,504,1266
One purpose of long-term saving is to cover needs in old age;,505,1267
"those who can should rightly contribute to their care from savings and accumulated wealth, rather than expecting current and future taxpayers to carry the cost on their behalf.",505,1268
"Moreover, many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices.",505,1269
Reconciling these competing pressures fairly and in a sustainable way has challenged many governments of the past.,505,1270
We intend to tackle this with three connected measures.,505,1271
"First, we will align the future basis for means-testing for domiciliary care with that for residential care, so that people are looked after in the place that is best for them.",505,1272
"This will mean that the value of the family home will be taken into account along with other assets and income, whether care is provided at home, or in a residential or nursing care home.",505,1273
"Second, to ensure this is fair, we will introduce a single capital floor, set at £100,000, more than four times the current means test threshold.",504,1274
"This will ensure that, no matter how large the cost of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least £100,000 of their savings and assets, including value in the family home.",504,1275
"Third, we will extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care to those receiving care at home, so no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care.",504,1276
"We believe this powerful combination maximises protection for pensioner households with modest assets, often invested in the family home, while remaining affordable for taxpayers.",704,1277
"We consider it more equitable, within and across the generations, than the proposals following the Dilnot Report, which mostly benefited a small number of wealthier people.",503,1278
An efficient elderly care system which provides dignity is not merely a function of money.,504,1279
So our forthcoming green paper will also address system-wide issues to improve the quality of care and reduce variation in practice.,504,1280
This will ensure the care system works better with the NHS to reduce unnecessary and unhealthy hospital stays and delayed transfers of care,504,1281
", and provide better quality assurance within the care sector.",504,1282
We will reduce loneliness,706,1283
"and promote technological solutions to prolong independent living,",706,1284
and invest in dementia research.,706,1285
"As the majority of care is informally provided, mainly by families, we will give workers a new statutory entitlement to carers leave, as enjoyed in other countries.",504,1286
"Creating a sustainable elderly care system means making decisions about how the rising budget devoted to pensioners is spent, so we will target help where it is needed most.",505,1287
"So we will look at Winter Fuel Payments, the largest benefit paid to pensioners, in this context.",505,1288
"The benefit is paid regardless of need, giving money to wealthier pensioners when working people on lower incomes do not get similar support.",505,1289
"So we will meanstest Winter Fuel Payments, focusing assistance on the least well-off pensioners, who are most at risk of fuel poverty.",505,1290
"The money released will be transferred directly to health and social care, helping to provide dignity and care to the most vulnerable pensioners and reassurance to their families.",504,1291
"We will maintain all other pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament.",504,1292
Our National Health Service is the essence of solidarity in our United Kingdom,504,1294
" our commitment to each other, between young and old, those who have and those who do not, and the healthy and the sick.",606.1,1295
The Conservative Party believes in the founding principles of the NHS.,504,1296
"First, that the service should meet the needs of everyone, no matter who they are or where they live.",504,1297
"Second, that care should be based on clinical need, not the ability to pay.",504,1298
"Third, that care should be free at the point of use.",504,1299
"As the NHS enters its eighth decade, the next Conservative government will hold fast to these principles by providing the NHS with the resources it needs",504,1300
and holding it accountable for delivering exceptional care to patients wherever and whenever they need it.,504,1301
"In five ways, the next Conservative government will give the NHS the resources it needs.",504,1303
"First, we will increase NHS spending by a minimum of £8 billion in real terms over the next five years, delivering an increase in real funding per head of the population for every year of the parliament.",504,1304
"Second, we will ensure that the NHS and social care system have the nurses, midwives, doctors, carers and other health professionals that it needs.",504,1305
"We will make it a priority in our negotiations with the European Union that the 140,000 staff from EU countries can carry on making their vital contribution to our health and care system.",504,1306
"However, we cannot continue to rely on bringing in clinical staff instead of training sufficient numbers ourselves.",411,1307
"Last year we announced an increase in the number of students in medical training of 1,500 a year;",411,1308
"we will continue this investment, doing something the NHS has never done before, and train the doctors our hospitals and surgeries need.",411,1309
"Third, we will ensure that the NHS has the buildings and technology it needs to deliver care properly and efficiently.",411,1310
"Since its inception, the NHS has been forced to use too many inadequate and antiquated facilities, which are even more unsuitable today.",411,1311
"We will put this right and enable more care to be delivered closer to home, by building and upgrading primary care facilities, mental health clinics and hospitals in every part of England.",411,1312
"Over the course of the next parliament, this will amount to the most ambitious programme of investment in buildings and technology the NHS has ever seen.",411,1313
"Fourth, whilst the NHS will always treat people in an emergency, no matter where they are from, we will recover the cost of medical treatment from people not resident in the UK.",505,1314
We will ensure that new NHS numbers are not issued to patients until their eligibility has been verified.,601.2,1315
"And we will increase the Immigration Health Surcharge, to £600 for migrant workers and £450 for international students, to cover their use of the NHS.",504,1316
This remains competitive compared to the costs of health insurance paid by UK nationals working or studying overseas.,505,1317
"Fifth, we will implement the recommendations of the Accelerated Access Review to make sure that patients get new drugs and treatments faster",504,1318
while the NHS gets best value for money,504,1319
and remains at the forefront of innovation.,411,1320
"It is NHS England that determines how best to organise and deliver care in England, set out in its own plan to create a modern NHS  the Five Year Forward View.",303,1322
We support it.,303,1323
"We will also back the implementation of the plan at a local level, through the Sustainability and Transformation Plans, providing they are clinically led and locally supported.",301,1324
We will hold NHS Englands leaders to account for delivering their plan to improve patient care.,303,1325
"If the current legislative landscape is either slowing implementation or preventing clear national or local accountability, we will consult and make the necessary legislative changes.",303,1326
"This includes the NHSs own internal market, which can fail to act in the interests of patients and creates costly bureaucracy.",303,1327
"So we will review the operation of the internal market and, in time for the start of the 2018 financial year, we will make non-legislative changes to remove barriers to the integration of care.",303,1328
"We expect GPs to come together to provide greater access, more innovative services, share data and offer better facilities,",504,1329
while ensuring care remains personal  particularly for older and more vulnerable people  with named GPs accountable for individual patients.,504,1330
"We will support GPs to deliver innovative services that better meet patients needs, including phone and on-line consultations and the use of technology to triage people better so they see the right clinician more quickly.",411,1331
We will ensure appropriate funding for GPs to meet rising costs of indemnity in the short term while working with the profession to introduce a sustainable long-term solution.,504,1332
We will introduce a new GP contract to help develop wider primary care services.,504,1333
We will reform the contract for hospital consultants to reflect the changed nature of hospital care over the past twenty years.,504,1334
"We shall support more integrated working, including ensuring community pharmacies can play a stronger role to keep people healthy outside hospital within the wider health system.",303,1335
"We will support NHS dentistry to improve coverage and reform contracts so that we pay for better outcomes, particularly for deprived children.",504,1336
"And we will legislate to reform and rationalise the current outdated system of professional regulation of healthcare professions, based on the advice of professional regulators,",303,1337
and ensure there is effective registration and regulation of those performing cosmetic interventions.,403,1338
We will also help the million and more NHS clinicians and support staff develop the skills they need and the NHS requires in the decades ahead.,411,1339
We will encourage the development of new roles and create a diverse set of potential career paths for the NHS workforce.,701,1340
"And we will reform medical education, including helping universities and local health systems work closer together to develop the roles and skills needed to serve patients.",506,1341
We want the NHS to become a better employer.,701,1342
We will strengthen the entitlement to flexible working to help those with caring responsibilities for young children or older relatives.,701,1343
"We will introduce new services for employees to give them the support they need, including quicker access to mental health and musculoskeletal services.",701,1344
"We will act to reduce bullying rates in the NHS, which are far too high.",701,1345
We will take vigorous and immediate action against those who abuse or attack the people who work for and make our NHS.,605.1,1346
"Outcomes in the NHS for most major conditions are considerably better than three, five or ten years ago.",504,1348
"However, the founding intention for the NHS was to provide good levels of care to everyone, wherever they live.",503,1349
This has not yet been achieved: there remain significant variations in outcomes and quality across services and across the country.,503,1350
We will act to put this right.,503,1351
"To help the NHS provide exceptional care in all parts of England, we will make clinical outcomes more transparent so that clinicians and frontline staff can learn more easily from the best units and practices,",303,1352
"and where there is clear evidence of poor patient outcomes, we will take rapid corrective action.",303,1353
We will ensure patients have the information they need to understand local services and hold them to account.,201.1,1354
"We will empower patients, giving them a greater role in their own treatment",201.1,1355
and use technology to put care at their convenience.,411,1356
"In addition to the digital tools patients already have, we will give patients, via digital means or over the phone, the ability to book appointments, contact the 111 service, order repeat prescriptions, and access and update aspects of their care records,",411,1357
as well as control how their personal data is used.,201.1,1358
We will continue to expand the number of NHS approved apps that can help monitor care and provide support for physical and mental health conditions.,411,1359
We will pilot the live publication of waiting times data for A&Es and other urgent care services.,411,1360
We will further expand the use of personal budgets.,504,1361
We will also continue to take action to reduce obesity and support our National Diabetes Prevention Programme.,504,1362
Our ambition is also to provide exceptional care to patients whenever they need it.,504,1363
That is why we want England to be the first nation in the world to provide a truly seven-day healthcare service.,504,1364
That ambition starts with primary care.,504,1365
"Already 17 million people can get routine weekend or evening appointments at either their own GP surgery or one nearby, and this will expand to the whole population by 2019.",504,1366
"In hospitals, we will make sure patients receive proper consultant supervision every day of the week with weekend access to the key diagnostic tests needed to support urgent care.",504,1367
"We will also ensure hospitals can discharge emergency admissions at a similar rate at weekends as on weekdays, so that when someone is medically fit to leave hospital they can, whichever day of the week it is.",504,1368
We will retain the 95 per cent A&E target and the 18-week elective care standard so that those needing care receive it in a timely fashion.,504,1369
We will continue to help the NHS on its journey to being the safest healthcare system in the world.,504,1370
We will extend the scope of the CQC to cover the health-related services commissioned by local authorities.,504,1371
We will legislate for an independent healthcare safety investigations body in the NHS.,504,1372
"We will require the NHS to continue to reduce infant and maternal deaths, which remain too high.",504,1373
Our commitment to consistent high quality care for everyone applies to all conditions.,504,1374
We will set new standards in some priority areas and also improve our response to historically underfunded and poorly understood disease groups.,504,1375
"In cancer services, we will deliver the new promise to give patients a definitive diagnosis within 28 days by 2020,",504,1376
while expanded screening and a major radiotherapy equipment upgrade will help ensure many more people survive cancer.,504,1377
"We will continue to rectify the injustice suffered by those with mental health problems, by ensuring that they get the care and support they deserve.",504,1378
"So we will make sure there is more support in every part of the country by recruiting up to 10,000 more mental health professionals.",504,1379
We shall require all our medical staff to have a deeper understanding of mental health and all trainees will get a chance to experience working in mental health disciplines;,504,1380
we shall ensure medical exams better reflect the importance of this area.,504,1381
"And we will improve the co-ordination of mental health services with other local services, including police forces and drug and alcohol rehabilitation services.",504,1382
We have a specific task to improve standards of care for those with learning disabilities and autism.,504,1383
We will work to reduce stigma and discrimination,503,1384
and implement in full the Transforming Care Programme.,504,1385
We will improve the care we give people at the end of life.,504,1386
"We will fulfil the commitment we made that every person should receive attentive, high quality, compassionate care, so that their pain is eased, their spiritual needs met and their wishes for their closing weeks, days and hours respected.",504,1387
"We will ensure all families who lose a baby are given the bereavement support they need, including a new entitlement to child bereavement leave.",504,1388
"We have not built enough homes in this country for generations,",411,1390
and buying or renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable.,503,1391
"If we do not put this right, we will be unable to extend the promise of a decent home, let alone home ownership, to the millions who deserve it.",503,1392
We will fix the dysfunctional housing market so that housing is more affordable and people have the security they need to plan for the future.,412,1393
The key to this is to build enough homes to meet demand.,411,1394
"That will slow the rise in housing costs so more ordinary, working families can afford to buy a home",701,1395
and bring the cost of renting down.,503,1396
"And it will ensure that more private capital is invested in more productive investment, helping the economy to grow faster and more securely in future years.",410,1397
We will meet our 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and we will deliver half a million more by the end of 2022.,411,1398
"We will deliver the reforms proposed in our Housing White Paper to free up more land for new homes in the right places,",411,1399
speed up build-out by encouraging modern methods of construction,411,1400
and give councils powers to intervene where developers do not act on their planning permissions;,301,1401
and we will diversify who builds homes in this country.,503,1402
More homes will not mean poor quality homes.,411,1403
"For too long, careless developers, high land costs and poor planning have conspired to produce housing developments that do not enhance the lives of those living there.",411,1404
"We have not provided the infrastructure, parks, quality of space and design that turns housing into community and makes communities prosperous and sustainable.",411,1405
"The result is felt by many ordinary, working families.",701,1406
"Too often, those renting or buying a home on a modest income have to tolerate substandard developments -some only a few years old",503,1407
"-and are denied a decent place in which to live, where they can put down roots and raise children.",603,1408
"For a country boasting the finest architects and planners in the world, this is unacceptable.",411,1409
"We will build better houses, to match the quality of those we have inherited from previous generations.",411,1410
"That means supporting high-quality, high-density housing like mansion blocks, mews houses and terraced streets.",411,1411
"It means maintaining the existing strong protections on designated land like the Green Belt, National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.",501,1412
"It means not just concentrating development in the south-east but rebalancing housing growth across the country, in line with our modern industrial strategy.",411,1413
"It means government building 160,000 houses on its own land.",411,1414
"It means supporting specialist housing where it is needed, like multigenerational homes and housing for older people, including by helping housing associations increase their specialist housing stock.",706,1415
We will never achieve the numbers of new houses we require without the active participation of social and municipal housing providers.,411,1416
"This must not be done at the expense of high standards, however: councils have been amongst the worst offenders in failing to build sustainable, integrated communities.",606.1,1417
"In some instances, they have built for political gain rather than for social purpose.",606.1,1418
"So we will help councils to build, but only those councils who will build high-quality, sustainable and integrated communities.",606.1,1419
"We will enter into new Council Housing Deals with ambitious, pro-development, local authorities to help them build more social housing.",504,1420
"We will work with them to improve their capability and capacity to develop more good homes,",411,1421
as well as providing them with significant low-cost capital funding.,504,1422
"In doing so, we will build new fixed-term social houses, which will be sold privately after ten to fifteen years with an automatic Right to Buy for tenants, the proceeds of which will be recycled into further homes.",504,1423
We will reform Compulsory Purchase Orders to make them easier and less expensive for councils to use and to make it easier to determine the true market value of sites.,303,1424
"We will also give greater flexibility to housing associations to increase their housing stock, building on their considerable track record in recent years.",402,1425
"And we will work with private and public sector house builders to capture the increase in land value created when they build to reinvest in local infrastructure, essential services and further housing, making it both easier and more certain that public sector landowners, and communities themselves, benefit from the increase in land value from urban regeneration and development.",411,1426
"And we will continue our £2.5 billion flood defence programme that will put in place protection for 300,000 existing homes by 2021.",411,1427
"These ambitious policies will mean more and better homes, welcomed by existing communities because they add, rather than subtract, from what is already there.",606.1,1428
"This is the sustainable development we need to see happen in every village, town and city across our country.",606.1,1429
"These policies will take time, and meanwhile we will continue to support those struggling to buy or rent a home, including those living in a home owned by a housing association.",504,1430
Britain should be the best country in the world for children.,706,1432
"We want to reduce levels of child poverty,",504,1433
"and have high ambitions for the quality of childcare,",504,1434
childrens health,504,1435
and support for vulnerable children for whom the state acts as a parent.,504,1436
We know high-quality childcare is important not just to working parents but even more so to a childs development and happiness.,504,1438
"That is why a Conservative government will introduce, this year, thirty hours of free childcare for three and four-year-olds for working parents who find it difficult to manage the costs of childcare.",504,1439
We will go further.,504,1440
"The next Conservative government will assess what more is needed, including looking at the best ways that childcare is provided elsewhere in Europe and the world.",504,1441
"As a sign of our commitment, we will immediately institute a capital fund to help primary schools develop nurseries where they currently do not have the facilities to provide one.",504,1442
We will introduce a presumption that all new primary schools should include a nursery.,504,1443
"And we will continue to support maintained nurseries and allow them to take on academy freedoms, supporting them to grow independently or as part of a multi-academy trust.",504,1444
We believe government has a role to play in helping young people get the best possible start in life.,504,1446
"We are seeing progress: smoking rates are now lower than France or Germany,",504,1447
drinking rates have fallen below the European average,504,1448
and teenage pregnancies are at record lows.,504,1449
We will continue to take action to reduce childhood obesity.,504,1450
"We will promote efforts to reduce unhealthy ingredients and provide clearer food information for consumers, as our decision to leave the European Union will give us greater flexibility over the presentation of information on packaged food.",403,1451
"We shall continue to support school sport, delivering on our commitment to double support for sports in primary schools.",506,1452
We understand the massively increased pressures on young peoples mental health.,706,1453
We will take focused action to provide the support needed by children and young people.,504,1454
Half of all mental health conditions become established in people before the age of fourteen.,706,1455
So we will ensure better access to care for children and young people.,504,1456
A Conservative government will publish a green paper on young peoples mental health before the end of this year.,706,1457
We will introduce mental health first aid training for teachers in every primary and secondary school by the end of the parliament,504,1458
and ensure that every school has a single point of contact with mental health services.,504,1459
Every child will learn about mental wellbeing and the mental health risks of internet harms in the curriculum.,506,1460
And we will reform Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services so that children with serious conditions are seen within an appropriate timeframe and no child has to leave their local area and their family to receive normal treatment.,504,1461
We have made significant progress in helping vulnerable children and families over the past seven years.,504,1463
"Our investments in the social work profession and in successful, innovative programmes have given tens of thousands of vulnerable families the coordinated support they need.",504,1464
Placing a child under the oversight of social services and taking a child into care are amongst the most serious duties the state may discharge.,504,1465
"We will demand all local authorities be commissioners of the highest- quality family support and child protection services, removing these responsibilities from the weakest councils and placing them in trust.",504,1466
We will ensure that councils provide consistency of care and cannot relocate vulnerable children far from their home when it is not in their best interests to do so.,504,1467
"We will review support for Children in Need to understand why their outcomes are so poor and what more support they might require, in and out of school.",504,1468
"Finally, we shall explore ways to improve the family justice system.",605.1,1469
"The family courts need to do more to support families, valuing the roles of mothers and fathers, while ensuring parents face up to their responsibilities.",603,1470
"Theresa Mays Conservatives will deliver ·The worlds most dynamic digital economy, giving digital businesses access to the investment, skills and talent they need to succeed.",411,1472
"Protections for peoples data online, backed by a new data protection law.",403,1473
"Safety for children online,",605.1,1474
and new rights to require social media companies to delete information about young people as they turn eighteen.,201.1,1475
"Digital government and public services, using data and digital technology to transform school choice, local services and issues like planning and social care.",303,1476
"New rules for the digital economy, underpinned by domestic regulation and international partnership.",403,1477
"Security online, with unprecedented investment in cyber security and stronger cyber standards for government and public services.",605.1,1478
"The opportunities and threats arising from the advance of digital technology pose significant practical and philosophical challenges to people, communities and governments around the world.",416.2,1479
"These new technologies provide us with new and faster ways to communicate, learn, travel, have fun and do business.",411,1480
They accelerate the pace of change  ushering in new norms in the space of years rather than decades; challenging our laws and regulations to keep pace.,416.2,1481
"The UK has always been at the forefront of such changes, from the earliest days of computing to the development of the World Wide Web.",411,1482
"Today, we continue that tradition with our world-leading digital economy, boasting particular expertise in artificial intelligence, cyber security, gaming, FinTech, GovTech, and virtual reality.",411,1483
"We are optimistic about the opportunities on offer in the digital age, but we understand these opportunities come with new challenges and threats  to our security, privacy, emotional wellbeing, mental health and the safety of our children.",416.2,1484
"A Conservative government will respond to these challenges, to assure the British people of security and fairness in the new digital age,",403,1485
and to strengthen the UKs position as one of the worlds leading digital economies.,601.1,1486
"For hundreds of years, the United Kingdom has determined the rules and formed the environment where new ideas and new technologies prosper  from financial markets to the steam train to human embryology and the code of life itself.",601.1,1488
Our wealth and security as a nation is founded on our ability to shape the future not just for ourselves but for the world.,601.1,1489
"Now we must do it again, to create the rules-based framework in which the new technologies can create prosperity and growth.",410,1490
"A Conservative government will develop a digital charter, working with industry and charities to establish a new framework that balances freedom",201.1,1491
"with protection for users,",403,1492
and offers opportunities alongside obligations for businesses and platforms.,403,1493
This charter has two fundamental aims: that we will make Britain the best place to start and run a digital business;,402,1494
and that we will make Britain the safest place in the world to be online.,605.1,1495
Britains future prosperity will be built on our technical capability and creative flair.,411,1497
"Through our modern industrial strategy and digital strategy, we will help digital companies at every stage of their growth.",402,1498
"We will help innovators and startups, by encouraging early stage investment and considering further incentives under our worldleading Enterprise Investment Scheme and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme.",402,1499
"We will help digital businesses to scale up and grow, with an ambition for many more to list here in the UK,",402,1500
"and open new offices of the British Business Bank in Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester and Newport, specialising in the local sector.",411,1501
"As we set out in chapter one, we will ensure digital businesses have access to the best talent from overseas to compete with anywhere in the world.",602.2,1502
"This will be complemented by at least one new institute of technology in the UK, dedicated to world-leading digital skills and developed and run in partnership with the tech industry.",411,1503
"When we leave the European Union, we will fund the British Business Bank with the repatriated funds from the European Investment Fund.",402,1504
"We will ensure there is a sustainable business model for high-quality media online, to create a level playing field for our media and creative industries.",416.2,1505
We will help provide the skills and digital infrastructure that creative companies need,411,1506
"and will seek to build upon the favourable tax arrangements that have helped them, including the highly successful creative industries tax credits scheme.",402,1507
"We will ensure there is a robust system for protection of intellectual property when the UK has left the EU, with strong protections against infringement.",401,1508
We will make doing business online easier for companies,402,1509
and consumers.,403,1510
We will give businesses the right to insist on a digital signature and the right to digital cancellation of contracts.,402,1511
"We will oblige all digital companies to provide digital receipts, clearer terms and conditions when selling goods and services online and support new digital proofs of identification.",403,1512
We will give consumers the same protections in online markets as they have on the high street.,403,1513
"For broadband customers, we will make broadband switching easier and pricing more transparent.",403,1514
We will ensure that consumers and businesses have access to the digital infrastructure they need to succeed.,411,1515
"By the end of this year, 19 out of 20 premises will have access to superfast broadband and our Universal Service Obligation will ensure that by 2020 every home and every business in Britain has access to high speed broadband.",411,1516
We will work to provide gigaspeed connectivity to as many businesses and homes as possible.,411,1517
"We will introduce a full fibre connection voucher for companies across the country by 2018 and by 2022 we will have major fibre spines in over a hundred towns and cities, with ten million premises connected to full fibre and a clear path to national coverage over the next decade.",411,1518
We have similar ambitions for mobile phone coverage.,411,1519
By 2022 we will extend mobile coverage further to 95 per cent geographic coverage of the UK.,411,1520
"By the same date, all major roads and main line trains will enjoy full and uninterrupted mobile phone signal, alongside guaranteed WiFi internet service on all such trains.",411,1521
"We will continue to reléase more spectrum from public sector use to allow greater private sector access and begin the roll-out of a new 5G network, providing gigaspeed connection to your smart phone.",411,1522
We plan to have the majority of the population covered by a 5G signal by 2027.,411,1523
"In harnessing the digital revolution, we must take steps to protect the vulnerable and give people confidence to use the internet without fear of abuse, criminality or exposure to horrific content.",605.1,1525
Our starting point is that online rules should reflect those that govern our lives offline.,605.1,1526
"It should be as unacceptable to bully online as it is in the playground, as difficult to groom a young child on the internet as it is in a community, as hard for children to access violent and degrading pornography online as it is in the high street, and as difficult to commit a crime digitally as it is physically.",605.1,1527
"Where technology can find a solution, we will pursue it.",411,1528
"We will work with industry to introduce new protections for minors, from images of pornography, violence, and other age-inappropriate content not just on social media but in app stores and content sites as well.",605.1,1529
"We will put a responsibility on industry not to direct users  even unintentionally  to hate speech, pornography, or other sources of harm.",605.1,1530
"We will make clear the responsibility of platforms to enable the reporting of inappropriate, bullying, harmful or illegal content, with take-down on a comply-or-explain basis.",605.1,1531
"We will continue to push the internet companies to deliver on their commitments to develop technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda,",605.1,1532
to help smaller companies build their capabilities,402,1533
and to provide support for civil society organisations to promote alternative and counter-narratives.,606.1,1534
"In addition, we do not believe that there should be a safe space for terrorists to be able to communicate online and will work to prevent them from having this capability.",605.1,1535
"We will educate todays young people in the harms of the internet and how best to combat them, introducing comprehensive Relationships and Sex Education in all primary and secondary schools to ensure that children learn about the risks of the internet, including cyberbullying and online grooming.",506,1536
"Where we believe people need more protections to keep them safe, we will act to protect them.",605.1,1537
"We will give people new rights to ensure they are in control of their own data, including the ability to require major social media platforms to delete information held about them at the age of 18, the ability to access and export personal data, and an expectation that personal data held should be stored in a secure way.",202.1,1538
"To create a sound ethical framework for how data is used, we will institute an expert Data Use and Ethics Commission to advise regulators and parliament on the nature of data use and how best to prevent its abuse.",202.1,1539
The Commission will help us to develop the principles and rules that will give people confidence that their data is being handled properly.,202.1,1540
"Alongside this commission, we will bring forward a new data protection law, fit for our new data age, to ensure the very best standards for the safe,",605.1,1541
flexible and dynamic use of data,402,1542
and enshrining our global leadership in the ethical and proportionate regulation of data.,601.1,1543
We will put the National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care on a statutory footing to ensure data security standards are properly enforced.,605.1,1544
We will continue with our £1.9 billion investment in cyber security and build on the successful establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre through our worldleading cyber security strategy.,104,1545
"We will make sure that our public services, businesses, charities and individual users are protected from cyber risks.",104,1546
"We will further strengthen cyber security standards for government and public services, requiring all public services to follow the most up to date cyber security techniques appropriate.",303,1547
"At a time when the internet is changing the way people obtain their news, we also need to take steps to protect the reliability and objectivity of information that is essential to our democracy and a free and independent press.",202.1,1549
We will ensure content creators are appropriately rewarded for the content they make available online.,202.1,1550
We will be consistent in our approach to regulation of online and offline media.,202.1,1551
"Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and given the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press.",605.2,1552
"We will repeal Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2014, which, if enacted, would force media organisations to become members of a flawed regulatory system or risk having to pay the legal costs of both sides in libel and privacy cases, even if they win.",605.2,1553
We believe government should not only be exceptional in dealing digitally with the people it serves but should also at the forefront of using digital technology in all its systems so that it can deliver better public services.,303,1555
"We will therefore create a new presumption of digital government services by default and an expectation that all government services are fully accessible online, with assisted digital support available for all public sector websites.",303,1556
"We will publish far more information about public services online, including relevant information about local issues and public transport so that every person can find out up to date information about roadworks, planning applications and bus routes online, without the hassle and delay that currently exists.",303,1557
"We will create new schools maps to help parents choose the school that is right for their child, giving them key information about quality of teaching, attainment and the curriculum of local schools as they choose their school preferences to support their decisions.",506,1558
"We will publish operational performance data of all public-facing services for open comparison as amatterof coursehelpingthe publicto holdtheirlocal services to account, or choose other better services if they prefer.",202.1,1559
"In doing so, central and local government will be required to release information regularly and in an open format, and data will be aggregated and anonymised where it is important to do so.",202.1,1560
"We will incubate more digital services within government and introduce digital transformation fellowships, so that hundreds of leaders from the world of tech can come into government to help deliver better public services.",303,1561
"We will continue the drive for open data,",202.1,1562
maintaining our position as the world leader.,601.1,1563
"If we are to make full use of this opportunity, we must use common platforms across government and the wider public sector.",303,1564
"That must start with the way we identify ourselves online, so that people have one single, common and safe way of verifying themselves to all parts of government.",303,1565
"That is why we shall roll out Verify, so that people can identify themselves on all government online services by 2020, using their own secure data that is not held by government.",303,1566
"We will also make this platform more widely available, so that people can safely verify their identify to access non-government services such as banking.",303,1567
"We will set out a strategy to rationalise the use of personal data within government, reducing data duplication across all systems, so that we automatically comply with the Once-Only principle in central government services by 2022 and wider public services by 2025.",303,1568
"We also want to use digital innovation to help tackle the great challenge of an ageing population, in conjunction with our social care reforms set out in chapter four.",504,1569
"We will support new providers seeking to use digital technology to monitor long-term conditions better, deploy carers to patients or support better domiciliary care away from hospitals.",504,1570
Digital technology will also transform the management of our national infrastructure.,411,1572
"We are leading the world in preparing for autonomous vehicles and will press ahead with our plans to use digital technology to improve our railways, so that our roads and tracks can carry more people, faster, more safely and more efficiently.",411,1573
"Smart grids will make the most efficient use of our electricity infrastructure and electric vehicles,",411,1574
and we will use technology to manage our airspace better to reduce noise pollution and improve capacity.,411,1575
"We will step up our programme of support for businesses developing these new technologies, creating a better environment for them to be tested in the UK.",411,1576
"And we will use digital technology to release massive value from our land that currently is simply not realised, introducing greater specialisation in the property development industry",411,1578
and far greater transparency for buyers.,403,1579
"To make this happen, we will combine the relevant parts of HM Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, the Valuation Office Agency, the Hydrographic Office and Geological Survey to create a comprehensive geospatial data body within government, the largest repository of open land data in the world.",411,1580
This new body will set the standards to digitise the planning process and help create the most comprehensive digital map of Britain to date.,411,1581
"In doing so, it will support a vibrant and innovative digital economy, ranging from innovative tools to help people and developers build to virtual mapping of Britain for use in video games and virtual reality.",411,1582
Some people say that it is not for government to regulate when it comes to technology and the internet.,403,1584
We disagree.,403,1585
"While we cannot create this framework alone, it is for government, not private companies, to protect the security of people and ensure the fairness of the rules by which people and businesses abide.",403,1586
Nor do we agree that the risks of such an approach outweigh the potential benefits.,403,1587
"It is in the interests of stable markets that consumers are protected from abusive behaviour, that money is able to flow freely and securely, and that competition between businesses takes place on a level playing field.",403,1588
"It is in no-ones interest for the foundations of strong societies and stable democracies  the rule of law, privacy and security  to be undermined.",202.1,1589
"So we will establish a regulatory framework in law to underpin our digital charter and to ensure that digital companies, social media platforms and content providers abide by these principles.",403,1590
"We will introduce a sanctions regime to ensure compliance, giving regulators the ability to fine or prosecute those companies that fail in their legal duties, and to order the removal of content where it clearly breaches UK law.",605.1,1591
"We will also create a power in law for government to introduce an industry-wide levy from social media companies and communication service providers to support awareness and preventative activity to counter internet harms, just as is already the case with the gambling industry.",403,1592
"Just as we led the world in regulating embryology thirty years ago, we know that if we create the right system of governance for the digital economy and use of data, we will attract the right businesses who want to become the global centre for data use and research.",411,1593
These are questions with which every nation is grappling.,107,1595
The internet is a global network and it is only by concerted global action that we can make true progress.,107,1596
We believe that the United Kingdom can lead the world in providing answers.,107,1597
"So we will open discussions with the leading tech companies and other like-minded democracies about the global rules of the digital economy, to develop an international legal framework that we have for so long benefited from in other areas like banking and trade.",107,1598
"We recognise the complexity of this task and that this will be the beginning of a process, but it is a task which we believe is necessary and which we intend to lead.",107,1599
"By doing these things  a digital charter, a framework for data ethics, and a new international agreement  we will put our great country at the head of this new revolution;",411,1600
we will choose how technology forms our future;,411,1601
"and we will demonstrate, even in the face of unprecedented change, the good that government can do.",305.1,1602
This is our plan for a stronger Britain and a prosperous future.,601.1,1604
"This is our vision of a nation united,",606.1,1605
"of shared opportunity,",503,1606
"of safe, vibrant and sustainable communities",606.1,1607
"and of a Great Meritocracy, where everyone, in every part of our country, is given the chance to go wherever their talents will take them.",503,1608
"In this period of profound national change, we will only achieve our ambitions if we have the strong and stable leadership our national interest demands.",305.3,1609
"With Theresa May and her team, we will secure the best possible deal with the European Union and chart a course to a new global future.",110,1610
"Now is the time that we must show, once again, our strength as a nation and the character of our united people.",606.1,1611
"We shall succeed, if we go forward, together.",606.1,1612
This is an uncertain time for the United Kingdom.,601,9
Scottish Nationalism has not accepted the democratic outcome of the referendum on Independence.,601,10
"They may have lost that battle, but their war continues.",601,11
"In fact, they have done more to destabilise the Union than Irish Republicanism ever did, and the Scottish Nationalist Party did so without bombs or bullets.",601,12
Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond see themselves as Kingmakers on the 8th of May.,601,13
Their SNP will not put the broader interests of the UK first and foremost.,601,14
"If their MPs are required to support a Government, then there is a very real prospect that it will further destabilise the Union, creating fear and uncertainty, not just among the citizens of the UK, but also with our global partners, economically and politically.",601,15
We have spoken to the US Administration and they do not welcome an undermining of the Special Relationship between the UK and the United States of America.,101,16
A stable Union is the most important result a good unionist should hope for in this Election.,601,17
"Ulster Unionist MPs will be responsible citizens of the United Kingdom, defending, promoting and advancing the Union at this time of immense uncertainty.",601,18
"While our MPs will seek to do the best they can for the people of Northern Ireland, we will also work in the best interests of the UK as a whole.",601,19
"In the event that neither Labour nor the Conservative Party secure a majority of seats in the House of Commons, the Ulster Unionist Party will not be going to Downing Street holding out the begging bowl.",601,20
"Neither the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland will profit from MPs intent only on short-term advantage, no matter what the longer-term damage that does to our place in the Union.",601,21
"The Ulster Unionist Party values are not an auction item, available to the highest bidder.",601,22
Instead we aspire to work with the UK Government to secure the tools and resources that will help us start moving away from our Dependency culture and start generating serious wealth for our people.,601,24
"We believe the Union makes sense: politically, economically, socially and culturally.",601,25
"Economically, you need look no further than the global league table of prosperity.",601,26
Who votes for relegation?,601,27
"While the UK economy is one of the strongest in the world, there are key challenges to be faced, none bigger than our debt mountain.",414,28
"Currently, the UK Government spends more servicing debt than it does on Education.",414,29
It is also more than is spent on public services in Northern Ireland and Wales combined.,414,30
That is an inconvenient truth for those who oppose actions to address the issue.,414,31
We do not wish to leave £1.4 Trillion of debt as a legacy for our children.,414,32
Rebalancing our economy should have three focal points for the public sector:,414,33
"At £1.4 Trillion, that equates to £54,353 per household;",414,35
"Every one percent of public sector staff time saved through increased productivity is worth £1.6 Billion to the public purse, or £64 Million in Northern Ireland;",410,37
"It is crucial that the current Voluntary Exit Scheme manages the radical change in public sector headcount, to ensure we retain the right people, with the right skills, in the right places.",410,39
"For our private sector, the challenge is simple: growth.",410,40
Over the last four years our National Health Service has been put under intolerable strains.,504,44
Health and Social Care Trusts being forced to make swingeing in year cuts to frontline services last year was an appalling demonstration of how badly the situation has deteriorated.,504,45
"We want to cure that, with: Better use of funding and resources;",504,46
Decisive political leadership;,504,47
Strategic vision for health provision.,504,48
"We need to get serious about prevention, ensure the NHS is fit for the future and more efficient in its use of staff, funding and resources.",504,49

"Investment in people, skills, facilities and resources;",504,52
Waiting times.,504,53
"The UK expenditure on health has now fallen behind many of our major European neighbours such as France, Germany and Denmark.",504,54
The trend within Northern Ireland over recent years is of ineffective investment whilst demand and cost pressures continue to grow exponentially.,504,55
"We will provide the political leadership that ensures there is a strategic vision for the future that takes account of changing demand, delivering the resources required to maintain a consistently safe and high quality NHS.",504,56

"Many cancer services are in crisis, with far too many patients waiting unjustifiable lengths of time for diagnosis and treatment.",504,59
"These factors impact hugely on staff morale, which is at an all-time low; the impact of underfunding and ineffective use of resources has only served to further undermine public and staff confidence in the health service.",504,60
"We will: Not compromise on the core principle of the NHS remaining free at the point of delivery, available to everyone based on need, not the ability to pay;",504,61
That includes falsehearted attempts to predetermine a specialised drugs fund on the reintroduction of prescriptions charges;,504,63
Put patients back at the heart of all the NHS does and ask frontline staff to tell us how best to transform the NHS back to its best.,504,64
"In light of the growing evidence that demonstrates higher death rates at weekends in our hospitals and in the knowledge that illness and injury does not discriminate in relation to time of day or day of the week, we will begin the process of ensuring acute services within the NHS are delivered 24 hours a day 7 days a week.",504,66
We will extend evening and weekend consultant coverage and ensure staffing levels match patient flows;,504,67
"We will tackle the shortage of specialist staff working in Emergency Departments, ensuring senior doctors are present 24 hours a day, removing patients fear of inappropriate or untimely treatment;",504,68
We will introduce a new revised workforce planning structure to ensure every hospital maintains safe and sustainable staffing levels.,504,69
We will reverse the trend of Northern Ireland having the lowest number of GPs per head in the United Kingdom;,504,72
We will ensure GP hubs are equipped to provide extended opening hours to reduce the number of patients having to seek help inappropriately at hospital;,504,73
We will place a greater emphasis on public health awareness campaigns and invest in early intervention efforts,504,74
; we will focus on keeping our communities well and preventing illness.,504,75
Dementia is a growing epidemic.,504,77
"Every year across the UK, dementia is attributable to 60,000 deaths.",504,78
"By 2025, we will have 1,000,000 people in the UK suffering from dementia.",504,79
We need to prepare the NHS now!,504,80
"We will make our health service dementia-proof, so that every health care professional is trained and aware, and every healthcare facility is dementia-friendly, tackling issues including light and sound, not least the sometimes chaotic and confusing environment of an Emergency Department.",504,81
Family members who care for people with dementia save the UK 11 Billion pounds every year;,504,82

"Frontline and administrative staff agree, there are huge efficiencies to be made to free up funds to make the NHS work for you;",303,90
"Following the significant reform of local health structures carried out by Michael McGimpsey, it is regrettable that only four years later a number of bodies set up to act in a more streamlined manner have actually been allowed to swell in size by over 40%.",303,91
It is clear there are significant savings to be made once again in the administration of our local health service;,303,92
We will review procurement in the Health Service;,303,93
We will ensure that all revenue raised through the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) goes towards ensuring our patients with rare diseases are no longer last to receive new revolutionary treatments;,504,94
We will reduce costs by introducing a new alcohol and drug misuse framework.,504,95
The NHS is the jewel in the United Kingdoms crown.,504,96
"We will protect it, revive it, restore it to good health.",504,97
"In return we will deliver healthier people, not least in the area of poor mental health and wellbeing.",504,98
Too many of our people wake up every morning with no real sense of purpose in their lives and go to bed without a sense of having achieved anything worthwhile.,504,99
"Good health, mental and physical will transform our society;",504,100
we will restore the NHS to its former glory.,504,101
We will sustain it and make it a service that everyone can be proud of and others envy.,504,102

"You can only build a strong, healthy and sustainable forward-thinking population on the basis of good physical and mental health, with a focus on prevention as well as treating illness.",504,104
It is our responsibility to create a clean and healthy environment to pass on to future generations.,501,107
"Yet, the challenge of tackling climate change is no less formidable now than it was five years ago.",501,108
"We will: In the absence of Northern Ireland specific legislation, reduce our carbon emissions in line with the United Kingdoms commitments;",501,109
"Require all public bodies, including our eleven local councils, to set carbon reduction strategies with accompanying targets to measure progress;",501,110
"Improve outdoor air quality, by continuing to reduce traffic emissions by further promoting public transport.",501,111
Well also continue our cycling revolution to allow more people to avail of this healthy and sustainable mode of travel.,501,112
Northern Ireland is facing an energy crisis.,416,114
We remain far too dependent on the import of fossil fuels as our capacity to generate power through traditional means is being much reduced.,416,115
A new approach is needed.,416,116

Secure a final resolution to the application for the North South Interconnector by using both overhead and underground cabling.,416,125
Northern Ireland continues to suffer from the worst rates of fuel poverty in the United Kingdom.,503,127
"Far too many households, over 43% at last count, have to spend more than a tenth of their income on heating their home.",503,128
Advances in tackling fuel poverty have been minimal with progress far too slow.,503,129
Its clear a new approach is needed.,503,130
We will: Introduce an extensive area based approach to identify households in acute poverty;,503,131
"Rectify the flaws with the current Affordable Warmth scheme, including the problems with self-referrals;",503,132

Make it a requirement for social housing to meet a minimum level of efficiency;,501,135
Make it a requirement for private rental properties to meet a minimum Energy Performance Certificate rating.,501,136
The importance of planning cannot be over-estimated.,303,138
"It impacts everything from economic development (airport runways, new retail outlets, factory expansions) to daily lives (neighbours building extensions to their homes, replacement dwellings).",303,139
"In short, it is key to our quality of life.",503,140
"We believe planning should achieve sustainable development,",501,141
whilst promoting economic and societal improvement.,503,142
"With the transfer of planning powers to our eleven new Councils, local people now have a greater opportunity than ever before to shape the look and functionality of their communities.",606,143
We will: Ensure a balance between sustainability and economic considerations in planning decisions;,416,144
Encourage greater use of land that has been previously developed;,501,145
Ensure that our Councils use their new planning powers to deliver more energy efficient buildings.,501,146
Northern Irelands countryside is coveted internationally and cherished locally.,501,148
"That requires that a balance must be reached to maximise the dual responsibilities of maximising the economic and tourism potential,",416,149
and our duty to preserve the countryside for future generations to enjoy.,501,150
We wish to reverse the unfortunate trend of recent years that has seen statutory bodies acting reactively.,416,151
They must be proactive.,416,152
"Instead of schemes such ASSIs (Areas of Special Scientific Interest) being allocated only to meet targets, we will ensure that communities are given the real opportunity to feed into the discussions on how best to protect their local landscapes.",501,153
"In addition, real focus is needed on preserving our historic built environment.",501,154
Buildings can be restored but if lost they can never truly be replaced.,501,155
We will: Tackle robustly the threat posed to our local biodiversity by invasive species;,501,156
"Work effectively with the European Union on policies such as the European Birds and Habitats Directive in order to ensure that breaches, such as those on Strangford Lough, are avoided;",501,157
Give local communities and land owners greater say in the designation of lands.,501,158
"Too often, animals in Northern Ireland are subjected to cruel and unnecessary suffering.",501,160
"Despite repeated media exposés of abuse of sickening proportions, animal welfare remains a major issue here.",501,161
Previous attempts to tackle the problem have clearly not been enough.,501,162
Further action is needed.,501,163
"The Ulster Unionist Party strongly believes in the principle that securing animal welfare and respecting the rights of those who engage in country sports, such as shooting, are values that should be mutually dependent - not exclusive.",501,164
We will: Overhaul the Welfare of Animals Act to deliver greater numbers of successful prosecutions;,501,165
Seek to regulate the sale of live poultry and domestic pets in open and indoor markets;,501,166
Review the online sale and distribution of cats and dogs;,501,167
Ensure all animals are stunned pre-slaughter with strict enforcement by DARD.,501,168
Our ambition for the people of Northern Ireland is simply put.,410,173
The Ulster Unionist Party wants Northern Ireland to be the most attractive region in Europe in which to do business.,410,174
Why? Because to succeed will make our people more prosperous and we believe that will be transformational for our society.,410,175
There was a time when this corner of the United Kingdom was a major economic powerhouse.,410,176
It led the world in ship building;,410,177
we had the globes largest rope works;,410,178
our textile industry was vibrant;,410,179
we produced brilliant engineers,410,180
and agriculture was a staple industry.,410,181
The Ulster Unionist Party wants Northern Ireland to once again establish itself as a major economic powerhouse.,410,183
"We may always require a Block Grant from Westminster,",410,184
"but we should aspire to be less dependent, generating our own wealth,",410,185
"and with it, restoring pride and a sense of purpose to our people.",606,186
"When we talk about the economy, it boils down to how much money our people have in their back pockets.",410,187
"In simple terms, there is a huge prosperity gap between ourselves in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.",410,188
"If people in Great Britain have £1 in their pockets, our citizens have only 77 pence.",410,189
"To close that gap, we need to start generating serious wealth.",410,190
Giving Stormont the power to vary the rate of Corporation Tax in Northern Ireland was an Ulster Unionist idea.,301,193
"We regret it was not resolved sooner, because it could and should have been, but that is in the past and the challenge now is to move swiftly to agree the Rate and Date.",402,194
We support: A rate of 12.5%.,402,195
"This matches the current rate in the Republic of Ireland and represents a 7.5% positive differential with GB, now that the UK-wide rate has dropped to 20%;",402,196
"Introducing the rate at the earliest possible date, which is 1st April 2017;",402,197
"Encouraging Invest NI, supported by Leaders of all the Executive Parties and Northern Irelands business spokespersons, to start immediately marketing Northern Ireland to Foreign Direct Investors,",402,198
"not least in the USA, where the Corporation Tax rate is 35%.",101,199
The Ulster Unionist Party never considered a lower rate of Corporation Tax as a silver bullet for our economy.,410,201
"Rather, it is the centre piece in a basket of measures, including: An appropriately skilled workforce;",410,202
Sufficient A grade office accommodation to meet demand;,410,203
Fast track planning for major economic initiatives.,410,204
"In order for Northern Ireland to meet its potential to make its people more prosperous, we need a new economic model;",403,205
"a model that is not so overly-dependent on the public sector, or which stifles private sector growth, or ignores the massive potential of social enterprises, which make up the Third Sector, the so-called not for profit businesses that plough profit back into the organisation and the communities they serve.",403,206
"In order to grow the economy in Northern Ireland we will: Seek to deliver the latent ambition among our business community for a Northern Ireland-owned bank, focused on promoting and advancing the rebalancing of our economy;",410,207
Support long-term business investment by opening up access to finance.,402,208
We will also seek a formal review of the market restrictions for new non-bank sources of finance;,403,209
Reform procurement to further open up the £3 Billion annual procurement budget in Northern Ireland to make it more accessible to our micro and SME companies;,403,210
"Reduce unnecessary business costs, especially for startups;",402,211
"Focus government on properly supporting, empowering and resourcing social economies;",403,212
Demand reform to EU regulations that disproportionately impact small and medium sized businesses;,403,213
"Ensure our councils adopt a town centre first approach, with out-of-town planning applications going through rigorous tests to check their potential impact on existing businesses;",403,214
Identify and remove gaps in our broadband and mobile network service provision;,411,215
"Foster and develop the untapped potential of the third sector, including Northern Irelands 3,300 community and voluntary organisations.",403,216
"This will include improving the relationship, communication and structures between Government and these organisations.",405,217
This is especially relevant for organisations that rely on funding from sources such as the European Social Fund;,403,218
Keep the interests of businesses and employers at the heart of the decision making process.,405,219
The Ulster Unionist Party believes now is the time to start commencing the transition to a single education system where children of all faiths and none learn together.,608,221
"There would be no more sectors, no more enforced social segregation.",608,222
"If we offer inoculation jabs against MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) why not give a virtual inoculation against sectarianism?",608,223
"If children share space and experience from age 4, you transform our future, by eliminating the ignorance of the other and truly embracing the strength of diversity.",608,224
"The Ulster Unionist Party has a vision of education where every child is valued equally for their individual, innate ability, creativity and talent, irrespective of whether it is academic, technical, vocational, sporting, artistic, or any unique combination of all.",506,225
"That means every child is cherished, not just the academic boys and girls.",506,226
"When Martin McGuinness became the first Minister of Education post the 1998 Agreement, he listened when you told him you did not like the 11-Plus Examination, but he closed his ears when you also said you wanted selection, because life involves selection; for jobs, sports teams, performing arts - name it, you will face selection!",506,227
"Our discussions and broader research with business leaders leaves us in no doubt: if we are serious about closing the prosperity gap, we need to align our education system to three key questions:",506,228
"What ability, creativity and talent lies within the individual child;",506,229
How does that fit within making our people more prosperous:,506,230
What do we need to change to make it happen?,506,231
"To improve the prospects of our young people, we will: Match Scotlands record where 80% of day to day expenditure is managed by School Principals supporting children, by cutting administrative costs and putting more of the budget into frontline, classroom teaching;",506,232
Resolve the post primary transfer stalemate.,303,233
The current commercialised nature of the test means the State has lost control of State schools;,303,234
"Recognise your childs education is about more than their transfer to post-primary education and bring forward a holistic package of teaching, learning and support.",506,235
Our commitments: We will target schools in deprived communities and introduce a pupil premium.,503,236
It is abhorrent that successive Sinn Fein Education Ministers have failed to break the cycle of educational underachievement in these areas;,503,237
"We will push hard to develop a skills-based agenda based around the STEM subjects -  Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths;",411,238
We will acknowledge and fix the problem of Careers Guidance.,506,239
"We should, could, and with your support, will do better for our children, by making careers guidance a core part of the Northern Ireland schools curriculum from the age of 15;",506,240
We support the retention of the Dickson Plan;,506,241
We will amend the Fair Employment and Treatment Order to repeal the exemption for teachers and end the requirement for primary school teachers in the Maintained sector to hold a Catholic Certificate in religious education;,604,242
We will end the postcode lottery for pre-school places.,503,243
"Currently, that allows the Government to boast huge success rates in placement offers, with no acknowledgement of the impracticality of families availing of same and the consequent lowering of the percentage of placements accepted.",503,244
The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1998 increased low-end wages for several million workers effectively overnight.,412,247
"However, as a result of only modest increases up until 2014, the value of the minimum wage has fallen significantly in real terms since 2008.",412,248
"We support the principle of the Living Wage, but given the Northern Ireland economy is constituted almost exclusively by micro and SMEs, for whom the Living Wage would represent an existential threat, the practical step for Northern Ireland at this stage is to restore the Minimum Wage to the position originally intended.",412,249
We will: Increase the national minimum wage over the next 3 years to rebalance the shortfalls from previous years;,412,250
Expect any company benefitting from the 12.5% rate of Corporation Tax to pay the Living Wage from April 2017;,412,251
Close taxation loopholes with zero tolerance on tax evasion;,403,252
"Seek to gradually rebalance the relationship between the Regional and Domestic Rates, to ensure a greater share of a households annual rates bill is collected for the benefit of their local council;",403,253
"Commission an expert panel to review business rates, listening closely to the often devastating impact rates have on our private sector;",402,254
"Support measures to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 by 2020;",503,255
Introduce a simpler PAYE payroll process for small businesses;,402,256
"Review the current pension tax relief rates so that greater support goes to savings from the lowest incomes, rather than at present disproportionality benefitting the wealthiest savers;",503,257
"Oppose reintroducing the 50% top rate of income tax for people earning over £150,000 as previous experience shows an increased rate could actually lead to a reduced total tax take.",403,258
The current 20% value added tax rate is crippling two of our key industrial sectors: Construction and Tourism.,402,260
"The Ulster Unionist Party has repeatedly argued the need for concessionary VAT rates for these sectors, to help rebalance our economy and grow our private sector.",402,261
"We believe Northern Ireland should learn from the experience of the Isle of Man, where a 5% VAT rate has applied since 1995 to hospitality, and from 1999 to aspects of construction, both with identifiable benefits to their economy.",402,262
"The Tynwald government, aided by HM Treasury, successfully lobbied the EU for a concessionary VAT rate for the Repair Maintenance and Improvement (RM&I) of existing dwellings.",402,263
"RM&I covers all activities to existing dwellings, from relatively minor works such as painting and decorating, to the more major, including extensions and conversions.",402,264
"In 1999, under Council Directive 1999/85/EC, the Isle of Man applied a concessionary 5% VAT rate to RM&I, with the Isle of Man Government assessing the initiative being responsible for:",402,265
Stimulating the construction industry;,402,266
Retaining skills;,402,267
"Creating new, permanent jobs, including apprenticeships;",402,268
Offering citizens an affordable way to improve their dwelling;,402,269
Regenerating the existing housing stock;,402,270
Helping Government achieve its target of reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050;,501,271
Reducing the viability of the black / shadow / informal economy;,402,272
Generating a perception of positive momentum and hope.,402,273
"While there is no reliable, discrete data for Northern Ireland, a forecast by Experian (global information forecasters) predicted that had a UK-wide 5% VAT rate for RM&I applied in 2010, this would have seen estimated revenue loss to the HM Treasury of between £102 and £508 million, but a stimulus effect of £1.4 billion, to include the multiplier effect.",402,274
"The Isle of Man has also operated a concessionary VAT rate on hotel accommodation, which has been judged to be a direct stimulus to that sector.",402,275
"Given Northern Irelands tourism competes with the Republic of Ireland, which enjoys a 9% VAT rate for this type of purchase, the 11% differential is clearly off-putting for potential visitors to Northern Ireland.",402,276
"The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, representing 85% of the hotel sector in Northern Ireland, report in their Tourism 2020 analysis, that the UK has the third highest VAT rate in Europe and is only one of four EU states that does not have a concessionary VAT rate for hotel accommodation.",402,277
"The potential benefits for Northern Ireland are measured in significant boosts to GDP, job creation, and additional tax take.",410,278
"We will: Seek a concessionary 5% VAT rate being applied to the Repair, Maintenance and Improvement of existing dwellings in Northern Ireland;",402,279
"Seek a concessionary 9% VAT rate being applied to the hospitality sector, to negate the marketing disadvantage with the Republic of Ireland.",402,280
"If Northern Ireland is to fully reach its potential, it must continue to invest in its biggest asset: its people.",606,282
We need to transform how we equip our people with the skills without which we will fail to deliver the bedrock of a new economy.,411,283
"We will: Ensure that every school leaver has three essential options: third level education, training for a skill, or an apprenticeship;",411,284
"Demand greater liaison between business, second and third level education, focused on marrying the individual young person and the needs of rebalancing our economy;",411,285
Support our micro and SMEs in the delivery of more apprenticeships;,411,286
"Ensure public bodies with over 50 employees, and private companies delivering major public contracts, are required to offer additional apprenticeships;",411,287
Increase the delivery of IT training and programming skills in schools;,411,288
"Continue to invest in research, development and innovation.",411,289
"In order for Northern Ireland to become a world class economy, it needs world class infrastructure.",411,291
"We will: Develop a 25 year vision for world class infrastructure, listening carefully to the needs of those who will drive the rebalancing of our economy;",411,292
"Build on our increasingly successful drawdown of competitive EU funding by DRD Minister Danny Kennedy, over £30m since 2013, to make infrastructure projects deliverable;",411,293
"Fill the gap in A-Grade office space in Belfast and beyond, an essential requirement of global service sector firms considering investing in Northern Ireland;",411,294
Fast track regionally important planning decisions;,411,295
Develop a robust and stable electricity transmission system.,411,296
For a small country Northern Ireland continues to be a world leader in a range of areas.,606,298
We have sectors such as the creative industries that are the envy of our much larger competitors.,606,299
We also have a tourism brand worth marketing globally.,606,300
"While Northern Ireland 2012 enjoyed a degree of success with the emphasis on Our Time Our Place, the Ulster Unionist Party regrets the failure to add our call for Our People to be the essential third element.",606,301
"With the Worlds Number One golfer in Rory McIlroy, supported by the immensely popular Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell, we have three citizens who open an unique marketing opportunity.",410,302
"Matched by the fact we have some of the best golf courses in the world (Royal County Down always in any sensible list of the worlds top 10; Royal Portrush again on the rota to host the Open), golf should be our greatest single driver of tourism.",410,303
"The target of £50m per annum by the time the Open Championship returns to Northern Ireland, possibly in 2019, should be more ambitious.",410,304
We will: Redirect £40m Financial Transaction Capital funding towards major projects that would support our tourism industry;,410,305
Promote apprenticeships using the Unlocking creativity programme as a model to release individual creativity and ensure young people are prepared for careers in creative industries.,411,306
"The agri-food sector is Northern Irelands largest indigenous employer, with 47,000 people working in farming and a further 27,000 working in food and drinks processing.",703,308
It is now worth well over £1Billion a year.,703,309
However despite the proven potential the Northern Ireland Executive has only recently started to commence its much lauded Going for Growth Strategy.,703,310
This malaise inevitably limited the growth of the sector in recent years.,703,311
"We will: Seek to build a single, sustainable supply chain where the provenance and reputation of our produce is not compromised;",703,312
Promote agriculture as a sustainable career for young people;,703,313

"As the UK Government has it: The armed forces covenant sets out the relationship between the nation, the government and the armed forces.",104,358
"It recognises that the whole nation, has a moral obligation to members of the armed forces and their families, and it establishes how they should expect to be treated.",104,359

Change is inevitable.,110,373
The Ulster Unionist Party believes there could be a beneficial future for Great Britain and Northern Ireland within the European Union.,108,374

We want the decisions that affect us made here in Wales //-,301,16
not by a Westminster government that doesnt prioritise Wales.,301,17
Wales must be treated as a nation and have the powers to act as a nation.,602,18
"Plaid Cymru believes that Wales is a sovereign country, and that power belongs in the hands of the people of Wales.",602,19
Its only fair that Wales should have the same powers as Scotland.,301,20
"Plaid Cymru were the first party to respond to the Silk Commission and the Independence Referendum in Scotland, publishing our Bring our Government Home paper and tabling far-reaching amendments to the Wales Act to give powers to Wales.",301,22
Plaid Cymru has long made the case for giving the Welsh Government more powers.,301,23

Much can be done to improve the way the four nations work together for the benefit of their peoples.,301,35

This will be a growing economy where everyone benefits - not just the richest 1%.,403,41

"As the economy improves, Plaid Cymru believes that everyone should benefit.",403,43

Plaid Cymru has consistently opposed the austerity cuts forced through the UK Parliament by the major UK parties because they lead to severe cuts in funding for Wales.,408,46
"Recognising the failure of UK economic policy, we published our plans for an Economic Fairness Bill to level up wealth across the UK, in both geographical and individual terms.",404,47

and create new jobs.,701,52
"So that wealth is shared out more fairly within the UK, and to ensure that Wales receives its fair share of public investment, Plaid Cymru will introduce an Economic Fairness Bill to rebalance the wealth of the UK.",403,54
This means that the UK Government would have to always assess the impact upon Wales of its economic plans before theyre put in place.,403,55
"We will create 50,000 jobs in Wales by giving more Welsh public sector contracts to companies working in Wales,",406,56
so that our economy benefits more from the £4.3bn spent by the Welsh public sector each year.,403,57

Investment projects in Wales must be better facilitated and managed.,402,74
"Plaid Cymru will give the Welsh Government the powers to guarantee major investment projects for Wales to give security that they will be carried out, with appropriate scrutiny of this investment to ensure it is well spent.",402,75
We support the Welsh Government having sufficient borrowing powers to invest in Welsh infrastructure projects and will increase those contained in the Wales Act.,301,76
We will commit 1% extra of UK GDP to infrastructure investment each year.,411,77
This would secure £800m to invest in Welsh infrastructure projects each year.,411,78
Plaid Cymru will also introduce our Build 4 Wales programme to borrow funding for Welsh infrastructure projects,411,79
and create a centre that specializes in major infrastructure project management.,411,80

Plaid Cymru will increase the minimum wage to be the same level as the Living Wage over the next Parliament.,412,90
"This will ensure a pay rise for more Welsh workers by 2020,",701,91
and could create new jobs in Wales through increased spending in local communities.,701,92
We will ensure that more companies alleged to pay below the minimum wage will be investigated and prosecuted.,412,93
We want to end exploitative zero hours contracts that tie workers to a company while not giving them a guaranteed weekly income.,701,94

"While recognising the value of any work during difficult economic times,",701,100
Plaid Cymru has highlighted the need for better paid jobs and a strong private sector so as to avoid under-employment.,701,101
One of the biggest challenges we currently face in Wales is getting people back into work.,701,103
Plaid Cymru disagrees with the Westminster parties who say that people are to blame for the situation in which they find themselves,701,104
and we reject the privatisation of schemes to help people into work.,413,105
"To help reduce unemployment, we will help people who have the most difficulty finding work, including those with a disability and who have limited skills and qualifications, to find a suitable job.",701,106
This will be achieved by dealing with people fairly and by focusing on what individuals can achieve on a day to day basis without the threat of sanctions.,701,107
Plaid Cymru will tailor job search and creation services to the needs of Wales by giving the job-search functions of Job Centre Plus to the Welsh Government.,301,108

"We support the European Unions Youth Jobs Guarantee that will provide training or employment to any young person under 25 who is out of work for more than four months,",701,110

Plaid Cymru MPs voted against the reduction in the additional rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in the 2012 Budget debate,503,127
- unlike Labour MPs who went home early.,305,128
"We will demand that Wales is funded to the same level per head as Scotland, helping us to provide quality public services and invest in our economy.",301,130

SCOTLAND WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE ANY GOVERNMENT IT LIKES AFTER INDEPENDENCE:,202,84
"in the first elections after independence the SNP will stand as a political party, but Scots will be able to choose any party they like.",202,85
Proportional Representation will ensure that Scottish governments are broadly based and that all parts of the country are fairly,202,86
represented - as will be women and ethnic minorities.,503,87
A vote for the SNP is a vote for Independence,301,98
"- it is also a vote to encourage change, because only when the SNP is strong do the other parties pay any attention to Scotland .",305,99
Constitutional Change has been promised to Scotland by the British parties for over 100 years - but nothing has happened.,305,100
"Nothing will happen unless the SNP is strong and determined, and attracting the support of the people of Scotland.",305,101
"New Labours scheme for a Scottish assembly is fatally flawed, and will deliver no real power.",305,102
The Tories are stuck in the bunker of no change whilst virtually the whole of Scotland is now scunnered by their anti-Scottish actions.,305,103
"Only the SNP offers a clear , logical and achievable blueprint for progress.",305,104
Scotland can regain its independence at any General Election.,301,105
"After the election of a majority of SNP MPs,the SNP will immediately initiate negotiations for independence with the UK government.",301,106
"In parallel with these negotiations, we will initiate talks with the European Union in order to facilitate the right conditions for independent representation.",301,107
At the conclusion of this period (which is likely to take between six and twelve months) the people of Scotland will be asked to approve the independence settlement in a simple one question referendum.,202,108
"On achieving the assent of the people of Scotland, independence will be declared and, after the formal establishment of an independent country within Europe,",301,109
a fresh General Election will be held to elect a new government.,202,110
There are many precedents for such a process: indeed during 1996 a committee of respected academics brought forward the final report of a study of Scotlands route to independence5 which clearly set out the steps to be followed.,301,111
During this study examples from other parts of the world were looked at closely.,107,112
"In the twentieth century the road to Independence is well trodden, and well signposted by those that have gone before.",107,113
An independent Scotland will have a written constitution and Bill of Rights.,203,116
"This means that Scots will be citizens, not subjects.",201,117
"They will be protected from the type of arbitrary interference that is the hallmark of Westminster government,",602,118
and they will be able to force the state to honour its commitments to them.,202,119
Almost every country in the world has a written constitution:,203,120
and virtually every democratic country in the world makes sure that citizens are guaranteed their rights.,201,121
A modern Scotland must have the same concern for law and liberty .,201,122
Earlier this year the SNP published its full constitutional proposals 6 which have been arrived at after lengthy and wide ranging consultation.,203,123
"The protection of basic human rights, including the right of free expression and assembly, the right to housing , education and free health care and the right to decent working conditions and a minimum wage.",201,125
"The rights of citizens in an independent Scotland will be at least as wide-ranging as those offered under the European Convention on Human Rights, which will be incorporated into the law of Scotland.",201,126
The establishment of a single chamber parliament elected by proportional representation which is modern in character,202,127
"and which in gender, ethnic origin and geographical representation accurately mirrors Scottish society as a whole.",503,128
The franchise will be extended to include all those aged 16 and over.,202,129
"Legislation will require public consultation, may be initiated by public petition as well as by members of the Scottish Parliament,",202,130
and a system of strong standing committees will supervise and regulate proceedings.,605,131
"Final legislation, having passed the Parliamentary process, will be approved on behalf of the people by the Chancellor of the Parliament,",202,132
not subject to the mumbo jumbo of Royal assent.,602,133
"The balanced parliament, elected fairly, and a strong investigative committee system",202,134
will replace the offensive and archaic House of Lords as the mechanisms to ensure properly thought through legislation.,602,135
Membership of a legislative body secured only by accident of birth or political patronage has no place in a modern democracy.,304,136
"The SNP propose the reform of the Monarchy which, while allowing the Queen and her successors to remain Head of State, would ensure that their duties and payments were clearly and openly understood.",202,137
In the absence of the Queen from Scotland the elected Chancellor (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament will act as Head of State.,202,138
The protection of the rights and responsibilities of Local Government will be protected by means of entrenchment in the constitution.,301,139
Local Authorities will also be elected by proportional representation.,301,140
"Citizens of Scotland, wherever they have come from, will be full participants in a twenty first century democracy,",202,141
not subjects of an outmoded and decaying eighteenth century state.,602,142
That change alone will refresh and invigorate Scottish life.,606,143
Independence is vital for our future; but independence is not an aim on its own.,301,150
The purpose of independence is not just to free Scotland but to free Scots - all the people who live in Scotland,606,151
"The Tory Government has been responsible for a vast increase in the National Debt, and an Independent Scotland would of course inherit a proportion of that debt, estimated to be around £38 billion.",305,152
"An SNP Government would commence a programme of repaying this debt , aiming to reduce the amount spent in interest and to free resources for further investment in the future.",414,153
The debt repayment will amount to a total of £6. 6 billion in the first four years of Independence.,414,154
The SNP aims for full employment -,408,156
"an achievable goal that is integral to the growth of the Scottish economy,",410,157
the delivery of a high standard of living,504,158
and the development of a secure and inclusive society in which every individual contributes and plays a constructive role.,606,159
"The SNPs four year budget will result in the creation of  an additional 100,000 new jobs;",408,160
in addition our National Apprenticeship scheme will increase the number of young people going on from school to meaningful training and through that route into useful work.,411,161
"In addition to the immediate jobs boost that independence will produce,",301,162
the creation of new jobs will come about as Scottish business is assisted to develop and compete.,402,163
"The key to such development will be the introduction of a sensitive and targeted corporate tax structure, allied to important initiatives to encourage small businesses that do not pay corporation tax.",402,164
The SNP is the only party in a generation to enter a General Election fully committed to a reduction in business taxation.,402,166
Cut the standard rate of corporation tax by approx. 10% from 33p to 30p,402,168
Cut the small companies rate of corporation tax by 22% from 23p to 18p,402,169
Limit the increase in the Business Rate Multiplier to the increase in the RPI,402,170
Phase in banded business rates with benefit targeted at smaller enterprises and with no increase for larger companies.,402,171
Abolish Class IV National Insurance Contributions.,402,172
These proposals will be phased in over a four year period.,402,173
We have allocated an average of £250 million per year from our budget for the creation of a Business Tax Reduction fund to pay for these measures.,402,174
"In addition to a innovative business tax regime,",402,176
"Government funding will be provided for priority economic projects such as industrial expansion, modernisation, agricultural diversification and the introduction of new technologies.",411,177
An additional £120 million over four years will be provided to enhance research and development of new products and processes.,411,178
"This will ensure that full advantage is taken of the intellectual capacity and scientific and technological innovation that is to be found in rich abundance in our universities and colleges, and in many of our businesses.",411,179
A Scottish Export Unit will also assist in building our export trade and focusing the attention of Scottish industry on the need to expand its excellent record in this field and will provide a massive boost to the international profile of Scottish business.,410,183
A Scottish Skills Foundation will be established to bring international best practice in skills and innovation training to bear on Scottish business and industry.,411,184
"The SNP has budgeted for a doubling of the Scottish Tourist Boards advertising and promotions budget and will assist the Tourism industry - which contributes in excess of £2.2 billion to the Scottish economy and employs over 177,000 people - to fulfil its potential.",410,186
"With the SNPs commitment to Defence Diversification (see Chapter 9),",104,188
to a modernised transport and communications infrastructure (See Chapter 8),411,189
"and with a successful Scottish approach to attracting investment the prospects for job creation and business birth, growth and survival will be better than ever before.",410,190
An SNP government will provide a context for business that is fair and flexible:,403,191
a Merger and Take-overs panel will ensure competitive practices and prevent asset stripping which has destroyed many Scottish companies over the past 20 years;,403,192
"a Fair Trading Unit within a Scottish Department of Industry, Technology and Employment will inherit and strengthen the responsibilities of the current utility regulators",403,193
and legislation will ensure that the practice of delayed payment that damages small businesses is outlawed.,403,194
A fair and flexible business environment will flourish if accompanied by active partnership with trade unions:,405,196
the SNP Charter for Trade Unions will guarantee Trade Union rights whilst ensuring that their responsibilities are enforceable at law.,405,197
Scottish endorsement of the EU Social Chapter will encourage Unions and employers to observe best practice that enhances constructive and profitable co-operation.,405,198
The introduction of a minimum wage (after discussion and with consensus) set at half median male earnings will be accompanied by an implementation plan developed in association with employers which assists smaller businesses to take this vital social step forward.,412,199
"For those in work, a fair personal tax system is an essential motivator:",503,201
the SNP aim to introduce a starter rate of income tax at 15p over the first four years of government.,503,202
For middle income earners the bands of income at which the basic rate is levied will be expanded by 15 per cent.,503,203
"This means that the top rate will not kick in until earnings exceed £30,000.",503,204
"In keeping with the belief that those who are best rewarded should contribute slightly more in order to assist delivering a just society , the ceiling on National Insurance contributions will be removed.",503,205
"Taken together these proposals will mean that there will be a drop in taxation for most, with a marginal increase in taxation for those earning above £26,500 per year.",503,206
85% of male employees and 95% of female employees will pay less tax.,503,207
But all will benefit from a more prosperous country and a fairer society.,606,208
These proposals are in keeping with the basic Scottish belief in progressive taxation and the sharing of responsibility according to the ability to pay.,503,216
"We will also cut VAT on Domestic fuel from 8% to 5% , the minimum allowed under EU regulations",503,217
"but will also negotiate with the EU to seek a new regime to take account of climatic conditions in Northern Europe, thus allowing the eventual abolition of this tax.",503,218
Move toward full employment,408,220
Achieve sustained growth along with increased investment,410,221
Secure continuing low inflation,414,222
Establish International Economic Credibility,410,223
Introduce a competitive business tax system,402,224
Legislate for a fair personal tax system,503,225
Build exports and inward investment,410,226
Strengthen the infrastructure and skills base,411,227
Adopt the Social Chapter and the Minimum Wage.,412,228
Introduce the SNP Charter for Trade Union Rights,405,229
"Job creation, business growth and economic success at home and abroad are aims that Scotland should aspire to given its wealth of talents and its strong resource base.",410,232
"But those underpinning strengths in the Scottish economy must also give rise to the development of social justice, education for life, health and public services which the Scottish people need and deserve.",504,233
Scots should be encouraged to take advantage of arts and leisure opportunities and to have their lives enriched by such pursuits.,502,234
And all these developments must take place in society that is determined to be free of crime and its effects.,605,235
The Scottish National Party is commited to a socially just Scotland,503,237
- the type of Scotland which the Tories have systematically tried to destroy for 18 years:,305,238
A Scotland in which poverty is eradicated and those in need are assisted to the maximum degree possible;,504,239
the Scotland that all Scots want.,606,240
"In our society there will always be a need for supporting those who cannot work, either through incapacity or for a variety of short-term reasons.",504,242
Government must also use the benefits system to assist those who are vulnerable,705,243
"- the very young, the old and those who are incapacitated",706,244
- and to eliminate the effects of poverty.,503,245
An SNP government will increase Child Benefit to £12.50 per week per child and maintain entitlement until a child has left school.,504,246
Child Benefit is a powerful means of tackling poverty as it is paid directly to the childs principal carer.,504,247
The annual cost of this measure wil £132 million by year 4 of an independent government.,301,248
"Benefit will be restored to 16 and 17 year olds immediately, as the Tory removal of such benefits has been a strong contributory factor in the rise of youth homelessness and youth crime.",706,249
"Education and training - with proper financial support - is the best way to assist young people,",506,250
but they must not be put in the position of suffering poverty and alienation because society will not assist them.,503,251
The SNP is strongly committed to eradicating the scourge of fuel poverty particularly so as Scotland is an energy rich nation.,503,253
Our Pensioners Package already forms the basis for action of fuel poverty for SNP councils:,504,254
we will ensure that the entire package is implemented at a national level - a package that will increase the state retirement pension by £3 a week for a single person and £5 a week for married couples as a first step towards achieving parity with the higher European pension levels;,504,255
introduce a Cold Climate Allowance of £9. 20 for all pensioners and others on benefits;,504,256
"remove standing charges from electricity, gas and telecom services for pensioners;",504,257
and abolish means testing for the residential care of elderly.,504,258
These measures will provide real relief from hardship and enhance social justice.,503,259
"In particular, the removal of standing charges provides a much more efficient and targeted way of making privatised utilities contribute to society than a one-off windfall tax,",403,260
while the abolition of means testing will remove a major indignity from old people and allow them to enjoy the fruits of their retirement without undue worry or stress.,504,261
Social justice also requires a new approach to the Scottish Health Service.,503,269
"The SNP will first of all establish an independent Health Commission, chaired by the Health Minister, which will consist of representatives of all political parties in the Scottish Parliament along with health professionals and representatives of local health care delivery agencies.",303,270
"Within the context of the health budget set by government, this commission will plan the strategic delivery of health services.",504,271
Local Health Commissions will undertake a subsidiary role in local planning of health care.,301,272
The SNP believe that free health care at the point of need is a fundamental right,201,273
and in order to provide such care we must remove the distorting distraction of the Tories internal market in the health service.,305,274
"By removing the tiers of accountants, administrators and middle managers we will abolish the artificial split between purchasers and providers of health care and will introduce an integrated health system which is administered and planned nationally but delivered locally.",301,275
This structural change is important - as is providing additional resources and finding a way in which the broad strategic priorities for health can be taken out of the day to day political arena.,504,276
"We will provide an additional £35 million per annum for the Scottish Health Service which, coupled with savings on bureaucracy (which consumes a staggering 12% of NHS expenditure) will provide a major and immediate boost for healthcare delivery.",303,277
The SNP will establish an on going national audit of health care designed to provide creative feedback and raise local and national standards.,202,278
Dentistry will be re-integrated into the NHS and we accept the view of the dental profession that capitation fees must be adjusted to take account of Scotlands dental health needs which are greater than those elsewhere in the UK.,504,279
This and other measures will encourage dentists to return to the Scottish Health Service.,402,280
"Prescription charges have increased, under this Tory government, from 20p to the current £5.65.",305,281
The system can be effectively reformed both by allowing patients to pay the real cost of drugs if these are below the prescription charge levels and by spreading the burden of charges more fairly.,504,282
The SNP will review the issue of charges and exemptions for those with long term mental illness who are not presently allowed exemptions.,504,283
Health care in a modern Scotland must be preventative as well as curative.,504,284
"An SNP Government will ban cigarette advertising and increase tobacco tax both to encourage more to give up, or not to start smoking, and to recover a small proportion of the costs of treatment of tobacco related illnesses by the National Health Service.",412,285
"We will also prioritise the improvement of nutritional standards in Scotland, using best practice both to encourage healthy eating and to protect the nations health by enforcing high standards in the production and distribution of food.",504,286
Care in the community is a laudable aim but it requires support with resources and with an infrastructure that the Tories have constantly eroded.,305,287
"The SNP will ensure that Local Health Commissions review the local delivery of care in the community, allocating resources to it as required.",504,288
"The provision of care in the community has a direct bearing on adequate local government funding, and statutory obligations imposed on local government must be backed up with financial provision.",301,291
So must any need to increase the involvement of voluntary organisations who are key facilitators in the provision of care.,504,292
The cost of democratic control of the Health Service through such Commissions will be considerably less than the present internal market which lacks both democracy and efficiency.,303,293
"As many as one in 10 of the worlds population suffers some form of disability,",705,295
"but society is still reluctant to legislate to ensure full civil rights for disabled people,",201,296
and to improve the quality of life so that all disabled people can fulfil their potential and contribute to the society of which they are members.,606,297
"The SNP will introduce measures, in the Bill of Rights and in other legislation, to secure full rights,",201,298
to enforce standards of building access and to help disabled people obtain and retain employment as they wish and are able.,504,299
"The SNP will implement its Charter for the Disabled to enable valuable members of society who are presently often excluded from the mainstream, but who have much to contribute.",606,300
"Whilst food safety is not primarily a health issue, until structures, controls and procedures go wrong, there is a clear need now to restore the reputation of the Scottish food industry and to provide a mechanism for public control of food quality.",412,302
"The SNP has been in the forefront of the campaign for an independent food safety agency, free of the pressure from the producers and able to take a proactive stance in securing the highest standards.",412,303
An independent Scottish Food and Consumer Health Agency will have a wide remit:,412,304
"it will supervise public health issues, working through local authorities and through local public health departments;",412,305
it will regulate food processing and handling and introduce clear controls that will better the European norm;,412,306
"it will consider public nutrition and health issues in their broadest sense and will assist in the process of promoting better eating , recognising that one of the principal barriers to a healthy diet is poverty.",504,307
It will also work closely with the producers to instil the best practices and provide a certification of quality that in time will be the passport to domestic and international success for the Scottish food industry.,412,308
Freedom from crime is an important freedom for many Scots;,201,310
"and whilst crime levels in Scotland have fallen in recent years many communities are still subject to unacceptable levels of vandalism, burglary and violence.",605,311
The SNP has supported initiatives that seek to reduce crime by means of a zero tolerance approach:,605,312
we will encourage such initiatives throughout Scotland and support them with additional resources for Scotlands police forces.,605,313
"Zero Tolerance brings improvement to communities by focusing attention on community crimes such as vandalism, petty burglary and other such anti-social activities.",605,314
By so doing it increases community confidence and pride.,606,315
It is an ideal solution for every part of Scotland and particularly for urban areas.,605,316
There are many practical steps that can be taken to cut down on petty or organised crime against property.,605,323
"One such scheme, which has been vigorously promoted by the SNP and which has the support of a number of organisations, is one which combats the £1.3 billion used-vehicle fraud that takes place every year.",605,324
A register of vehicles will be established which will allow purchasers of second hand vehicles to check that their intended purchase is legitimate.,605,325
The cost added to a purchase will be around £5.00 but the peace of mind afforded will be great.,605,326
Much police time is wasted for want of such simple and cost effective solutions:,303,327
much is also wasted in waiting for court appearances and the court system needs better resourcing.,303,328
The Procurator Fiscal service needs more lawyers and support staff and a stronger training infrastructure.,411,329
The solution to the problem of crime in Scotland does not lie in more prisons and more mandatory sentences:,605,330
these proposals have been rejected by the judiciary and by most commentators and it is an indictment of government in the last decade that our prison population is at its highest ever level - and still rising.,605,331
What is needed is a range of alternatives to prison and a flexible sentencing policy coupled with schemes for education and rehabilitation that actually work.,605,332
To implement and operate  such schemes the justice system must be encouraged to learn from international best practice and the SNP proposes the establishment of a research and development facility within a Scottish University to develop and implement education and rehabilitation schemes.,605,333
"The basis of community action against crime must lie in the community, and the SNP opposes the establishment of an all Scottish police force,",606,334
although we endorse the move towards sharing of skills between forces and the establishment of national strategic initiatives where appropriate.,605,335
"Scotland should never lose sight of the link between poverty, social deprivation and crime.",503,336
"Accordingly, whilst crime must be tackled at source, the creation of a better and fairer society will also have a strong impact on crime levels.",503,337
An economy that produces more jobs and more meaningful work for the people of Scotland will pay dividends in this area as well.,504,338
A major cause of criminal activity lies in the drugs culture that has developed in parts of Scotland.,605,340
"But drug abuse, like crime, is also a symptom of something wrong in our society, that needs to be put right.",606,341
"Yet there is not one drugs problem, but many.",605,342
And a variety of tactics are required to deal with them.,605,343
What needs to be put right first is the question of demand.,605,344
"If demand for drugs in society is curtailed, then the drug problem will diminish.",605,345
Tackling demand can vary from better resourced customs and police to more effective rehabilitation programmes in prisons and to drug education in schools.,605,346
All such measures are supported by the SNP which has been active in the all party campaign Scotland against Drugs.,605,347
Solving Scotlands drug problems also requires the collection of much information about drug use including much better recording of criminal statistics on drug related offences.,605,348
"The SNP also supports, and will encourage, local initiatives including Drugs Action Teams.",301,351
The whole world was shocked by the Dunblane tragedy;,605,353
but Scotlands call for action to ban all hand guns and to tighten restrictions on all other weapons was ignored by the Tory government.,605,354
"The SNP will introduce a total ban on handguns , making Scotland a safer place",605,355
and taking a major step towards eradicating the gun culture which is creeping into our country.,606,356
This measure will be accompanied by appropriate compensation for those deprived of their pastime,503,357
and the SNP will enforce the Cullen recommendations in all other areas of firearms control.,605,358
As a nation we must do our utmost to ensure that every step is taken to prevent another Dunblane.,606,359
"These measures, and the more stringent screening of firearm applications along with the establishment of a national register of firearms holders, will be a significant step towards that aim.",605,360
"Just as crime, social justice and health are priorities for Scotland, so are Education, Housing, Local services and arts and leisure provision.",503,368
"These community services, usually delivered at local level, need to be enhanced and improved if the quality of life in Scotland is to be enhanced and improved.",503,369
Labours so-called Passion for Education is a sham when the actual resources that are being offered  are examined closely.,305,371
In contrast the SNP has firmly costed changes that can be made immediately to the Scottish Education system.,506,372
Scotlands crisis in Education is the result of under funding;,305,373
"attempts to pin the blame on poor teaching, on the curriculum or on any other factors fail to take account of the constant erosion of morale and physical resources that has taken place in the last 18 years.",305,374
"An SNP Government will provide the extra resources to immediately employ an additional 700 teachers, and devote new resources to the repair and upgrading of school buildings.",506,375
"Both these actions are priorities, in order that class sizes can be reduced and classes taught in acceptable surroundings.",506,376
"Local Authorities, as the Education providers, need resourced adequately to undertake their tasks:",301,377
the SNP in offering additional resources to local authorities across a wide range of fields will ensure that the local authorities also prioritise education and are sensitive to local need;,301,378
there is no demand for opting out in Scotland and consequently the opting out legislation will be repealed.,506,379
However schools will be assisted to control more of their budgets themselves and to involve the school board in financial decision making.,506,380
Primary and Secondary schools will be enabled to take advantage of new technology and there will be guaranteed access to the Internet from each school as well as a programme to introduce computers into every classroom with the ultimate aim of all children using a computer terminal every day.,506,381
"Education is not just about schools: an SNP Government will introduce an entitlement to free nursery education for all 3 and 4 year olds whose parents wish it, and will make certain that such provision is properly funded.",504,382
The voucher system will be abolished.,503,383
"At the other end of the educational spectrum an SNP Government will support the Higher Education sector,",506,384
"first of all by replacing the Student Loans system with a return to maintenance grants at the 1990 equivalent, index linked for successive years.",504,385
Higher Education will have access to the Economic Development and Research Funds earmarked by an SNP Government as well as to the advice and assistance of the Exports Unit.,506,386
We support the establishment of a Scottish Education and Training Export Group to co-ordinate the overseas marketing of Scottish expertise in this area.,506,387
"For those who do not go on to Higher Education an SNP Government will improve training and skills development and introduce a Integrated Training and Employment Grant Scheme ,",411,388
"providing subsidies to employers taking on new employees in need of training, preferably the unemployed.",402,389
Training schemes of this nature should not merely rotate the unemployed into temporary positions.,411,390
We will add £50 million per year to the present youth and adult training budgets presently managed by Scottish Enterprise guaranteeing additional adult and youth training places.,411,391
In keeping with the multi cultural society in which we live,607,394
education in an independent Scotland will involve learning about the wide range of factors that have created our present society,506,395
and will look outwards to our European and world partners.,107,396
Gaelic and Scots have a place to play in this process and will be enhanced by such an approach.,607,397
"Gaelic medium education is of particular importance to many parents,",506,398
"and an SNP Government will require local authorities to ring fence dedicated funds for Gaelic medium education, as is presently done in Wales for Welsh language education.",607,399
The SNP is also sensitive to the needs of other communities which are part of the rich tapestry of Scotland.,607,400
"Schools with pupils from Moslem families must offer Islamic studies to such pupils as a matter of course,",607,401
"and the same applies to other communities which wish to take part in Scottish education, but which also wish to retain and develop their distinctive nature.",607,402
Scottish education will be enriched by such provision.,506,403
These policies are all necessary parts of the process of improvement that Scotland needs.,506,404
"There are three final parts which require to be considered: housing, local services and arts and leisure provision.",504,405
For many years there has been a deplorable lack of investment in Scotlands housing.,305,407
The result is a housing crisis with increased levels of homelessness and longer and longer council waiting lists.,305,408
"The Scottish Housing Conditions Survey has shown that too many of our citizens are forced to live in housing that is damp, overcrowded, poorly insulated and often lacking basic amenities.",706,409
"90,000 Scottish homes are deemed to be below tolerable standard and one third are affected by damp, condensation or mould.",706,410
An SNP Government will address this atrocious state of affairs by:,504,411
"Transferring Capital Debt: 75 percent of local authority housing debt will be transferred to Central Government in the first four years of an independent government, with the remainder being transferred in the following four years.",302,412
From a public expenditure commitment of £985 million this will release over £1.6 billion for investment over four years to tackle housing problems and housing need as well as other social priorities.,504,413
This one action should make a substantial start to solving Scotlands housing crisis.,504,414
"Eliminating Homelessness: Between 1978 and 1994 445,283 households applied to local authorities as homeless.",706,415
This is a national disgrace and needs to be attended to as a matter of urgency.,504,416
"So does the situation in which, as Shelter estimate, there are up to 1000 rough sleepers in Scotland on any one night.",706,417
An SNP Government will strengthen the existing Code of Guidance on Homelessness and ensure that in meeting the demands of the Code no one is left without a home in time of need.,504,418
"Build Homes and Raise Standards With the money released by the capital debt transfer up to 20,000 socially affordable homes can be built in the first four years, and a further 35,000 homes can be brought back from below tolerable standard.",504,419
"160,000 homes can be treated for dampness and condensation.",504,420
By applying higher standards of insulation money spent on upgrading can quickly be recouped in terms of energy expenditure.,504,421
"Some 300,000 houses have been bought under the Tory right to buy legislation, usually at a discounted price.",305,434
This has left a disproportionate number of council houses in poor condition as the best of the stock has been purchased.,305,435
It would be illogical to increase investment in socially affordable housing if it was then simply to be sold at a discount.,504,436
New or improved houses coming on stream from the building and renovation programme will be protected from the right to buy at a discounted price.,504,437
Those with existing tenancy agreements will however retain the right within the homes they presently occupy.,201,438
A right to buy at full market value will continue for all tenants.,504,439
"An SNP Government will replace Scottish Homes with a new accountable housing agency whose remit will be to deal with Scotlands housing problems, improve Scotlands housing stock and provide affordable housing.",412,440
Housing Associations and other bodies have a valuable role to play in these objectives and must be involved in policy formulation and in delivery.,202,441
The SNP is the only party which has costed a full programme of action to tackle Scotlands housing crisis.,305,442
"Such a programme will not only begin to eliminate homelessness,",504,443
it will also create many new jobs and provide a boost for the Scottish economy.,410,444
It will reduce housing waiting lists and move Scotland towards the provision of a home for all.,504,445
Those living in a better Scotland have a right to expect better local services.,301,447
"An SNP Government, having protected the autonomy of Local Government in a written Constitution,",203,448
"will expect local authorities to ensure that local services are efficient, effective and well targeted.",301,449
"As Scottish local authorities will be elected by proportional representation,",202,450
the monolithic and unresponsive one party states that Labour has created in many parts of Scotland will be consigned to the past.,305,451
"Local Government will have restored to it many of the powers lost to unelected quangos and there will be a review of the strategy and organisation of local economic development, with the aim or restoring local democratic control.",301,452
Local Government finance will be reformed during the first term of an independent Scottish government and the introduction of local income tax in a subsequent term will remove the anomalies that presently bedevil local funding.,301,453
Further adjustments to the support mechanisms for rural and island authorities would even out the support of local government by central government.,301,454
An SNP Government would abolish the Water Quangos and return water and sewerage to democratic control.,301,455
"Finally, arts and leisure provision are vital to the well being of society.",502,457
An SNP Government will encourage a programme of sport for all and will back that policy up by the provision of affordable community sports facilities managed by local authorities.,502,458
There will be ministerial responsibility for sports development and in addition to community participation it will be a policy aim to encourage international competitiveness and success.,502,459
Scotlands cultural life is of enormous importance and must be underpinned by an effective Scottish broadcasting system and a raft of public support that opens,502,460
"An SNP Government will reform Scottish Broadcasting , building on the tradition of excellence that exists but ensuring that Scottish programme making and Scottish concerns are at the heart of an internationally forward looking service.",502,463
We will retain a licence fee to support a public sector broadcaster (the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation ) but would encourage a diversity of commercial broadcasting on television and radio including at least one Scottish digital multiplex for a commercial service in the short term.,502,464
"Recognising that the age of effective protectionist broadcasting regulation is over, we would seek to ensure that the diversity of broadcasting channels observe the legal requirements of taste and decency while offering a wide range of services, and opportunities for Scottish based programme makers.",502,465
"Such services must include provision in Gaelic and Scots, but such provision must be accessible to wider audiences also.",607,466
"The SNP wishes to see a strong Scottish media production industry, which also means a strong Scottish film production sector.",502,467
"The introduction of tax incentives for production along the Irish model has been closely examined by the SNP in recent years, as has experience from elsewhere.",402,468
"An SNP government will introduce incentives for production and,",402,469
"through a new Scottish Screen (formed as a federation of film supporting, marketing and production orientated bodies ) will lay the basis for a renaissance in script and project development, commercial and non commercial production, marketing, distribution, exhibition and export of film.",502,470
The work of the Scottish Arts Council requires adequate Government support but we wish to see the refocussing of the priorities of the Arts Council to support people and traditional arts as well as long established institutions.,502,471
"A Scottish Academy will be established, encouraging excellence and bringing forward new talent in the arts.",502,472
"Gaelic and Scots must be given equal status with English, both legally and in broadcasting and the arts.",607,473
A Scottish Lottery would be established ( under the title Scot-Lot) with a more accountable system of distributing funds.,503,474
The jackpot payouts would be smaller but the chances of winning would be considerably higher.,503,475
"Scratch cards would be banned, given the problems of addiction and social disruption they cause.",503,476
"Scot-Lot resources would be available for a wide range of projects, but would not replace government funding for social services.",504,477
"They could be used for health research in addition to sports, charitable and arts purposes.",504,478
These many changes to Scottish life would make life in an independent Scotland a better experience for many of our fellow citizens.,606,479
The fact that all these proposals have been costed and can be afforded by an independent Scotland should indicate to all Scottish voters that our constitutional choice is clear and can be made in confidence.,301,480
A better Scotland in which all our citizens can live and work is the ambition and the intention of the Scottish National Party.,606,488
But the benefits of such a Scotland have to reach to every part of our country and in so doing any political party has to address other issues and concerns that arise,606,489
"- issues of traditional industries,",408,490
"special local concerns,",301,491
the environment,501,492
and the needs of Scotlands island and rural communities.,301,493
Land is the most valuable resource of a nation: but Scotlands system of land ownership and tenure is amongst the most archaic in the western world.,503,495
The SNP has accepted the proposals of the Independent Land Commission to abolish feudal tenure.,503,496
"The system of feudal overlords has been widely abused and has led to depopulation, massive profits for individuals who care nothing for the land and the people and insecurity for those who thought they had a title to their homes.",503,497
"It has no place in a modern country, and during the period of its abolition we will consult widely, at home and abroad, to create a modern and fair system of land holding that matches the best to be found anywhere.",503,498
We will establish a standing Scottish Land Commission to oversee the abolition of the old and the introduction of the new.,412,499
"Its membership will be representative of, and nominated by, local communities, land use interests, Members of the Scottish Parliament and Local Government representatives.",412,500
There are also interim and urgent measures that can be taken to outlaw abuse of the feudal system prior to a complete change in the law.,605,501
One such measure requires only the amendment of two century old Acts of Parliament to prevent ownership of local authority education buildings reverting to those who have speculatively purchased feudal superiorities.,503,502
We will  also transfer the powers of the Crown Estate Commissioners and other private owners of the sea shore and inshore seabed to local councils and local councils will be empowered to promote balanced land use and local access.,301,503
"We will also establish an all Scotland Land Register which will give open access to all enquirers and banish forever the mystery of land ownership behind which many have hidden in recent years, to the detriment of local communities.",403,504
Scotlands farmers have been hard hit in recent years by successive Tory failures and by a growing neglect of the importance of the agricultural sector.,305,506
"Scotland, as a sparsely populated country, needs a strong agricultural base",703,507
and that base can contribute greatly to Scottish exports and to the international reputation of our nation.,410,508
The agricultural sector already contributes 3% of GDP.,410,509
The Scottish farming community will be best represented by a seat at the top table in Europe for the country in which they live and by an independent Scottish government:,703,510
"our farmers and farming communities are presently of minor concern to any UK government, as the BSE crisis has shown.",703,511
"The SNP promoted a Scottish solution to the EU ban from day one, but the British government has refused to countenance such relief for Scottish beef farmers and the Scottish beef industry, even when invited to by the European Union.",305,512
"A tracability scheme can be introduced into the Scottish herd within a matter of months , giving Scottish beef producers the platform they need for re-entry.",703,513
Ending the ban is the first priority;,703,516
then we must work to restore our reputation in Europe.,108,517
No independent Scottish government would ever have allowed BSE to gain such a foothold,301,518
and our regulatory and animal health regime must become the best in the world again.,605,519
The Independent Scottish Food Agency will be a partner of the agricultural sector in restoring the domestic and international trade,412,520
and will also work with producers to instil and enforce the best practices in the world.,605,521
"Agricultural policy is not, of course, based only on what has gone wrong in the past:",703,522
"Scottish agriculture has tremendous strengths, rooted in the skills and experience of those who passionately care for the land and for the future of their businesses.",703,523
We need to develop a sustainable agricultural sector in Scotland.,703,524
We need to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure that support goes to those working the land as opposed simply to products and sectors.,703,525
"We need to develop new techniques, innovate in husbandry and production and widen the access to modern machinery, by supporting machinery rings.",411,526
"We must also promote sensitive rural diversification ( which will be paid for out of a rural development fund amounting to some £10 million per year) and sectors of the industry such as horticulture so that, with fair competition within the EU, we can widen the scope of Scottish agriculture and broaden the financial rewards.",703,527
A priority will be to assist Scottish producers to have more and better access to the wholesale market and to retail outlets.,703,528
The SNPs commitment to Scottish agriculture is firm and clear.,703,529
"Scottish farmers, producers and all those who work in ancillary industries, can only have their priorities met by an independent Scottish government which places their concerns firmly on the European and domestic agendas.",301,530
"Forestry is also a considerable national resource, and one which can be better used for the benefit of all.",410,532
The SNP will promote the development of a sustainable Forest Industry in Scotland by establishing a National Forest Enterprise Board (replacing the Forestry Commission) to undertake the commercial management and development of Scotlands national forests in accordance with the land use strategy agreed by the Scottish Land Commission.,412,533
"The key priority will be to double forest and woodland cover within 25 years, with a particular emphasis on native woodland.",410,534
This will not only have economic benefits but will also assist the environment by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide.,501,535
"In parallel with this development, the NFEB will work with the private sector to stimulate wood using industries , which deepened upon sustainable production from native tree species.",403,536
"Private forest ownership can be of great benefit but tax incentives for such ownership must be targeted towards those who intend to build forestry and the forest industries, not just shelter their money for a while.",402,537
"The SNP is also committed to greater recreational use of forests, and the Land Commission, in enabling better public land access, will be mindful of the need to secure sensible forest access as well.",502,538
"Crofter and tenant farmers have a role to play in forest development, treating (where holdings allow) timber as a common crop.",703,550
But this will be suitable for a small minority of crofters only.,703,551
The SNP wishes to see the Crofters Commission transformed into a National Crofting Development Agency with the power to assist crofting in the Highlands and Islands and small land tenure elsewhere.,412,552
The great strength of crofting is its ability to keep populations on the land and to prevent consequent depopulation of vital areas.,703,553
"Crofting is a way of life, but rarely a principal occupation.",703,554
"Accordingly assisting crofters to purchase crofting estates should be done as part of an overall development scheme for those areas, where new employment can be provided in new enterprises as well as enhanced crofting opportunities.",703,555
"The crofting estates that currently belong to the Crown should be returned to the people who live on them,",301,556
"but the opportunity to develop vibrant communities on crofting estates should not apply only to those who, by accident of tenure, are tenants of the Crown.",503,557
Private ownership should also be subject to regulation for purchase under clear conditions.,403,558
"All the evidence in the history of the Common Fisheries Policy points to the harsh reality that the UK has been happy , more often than not, to trade off fishing interests for other goals in European policy.",305,560
Scottish fishermen have paid the price for that UK hypocrisy.,602,561
"An SNP Government would use its improved influence as a full Member State in negotiations for a new European fisheries policy to ensure that the founding principles of the original CFP , in particular relative stability, are permanent components of future fisheries agreements .",703,562
"The processing sector, which provides vital employment and has good opportunities for expansion, must be supported particularly in an environment where rival sectors, for example on the Humber, are being allocated significant public resources.",410,563
The Scottish Exports Unit will be of particular help to this sector.,410,564
The fundamental objective of the SNP fisheries policy is to create a well managed and properly conserved fishery.,703,565
The SNP proposes six fundamental reforms which would assist the Scottish fishing industry:,703,566
A new framework whereby coastal states with the greatest historic interests in specific fisheries would be able to take the key control and management decisions relating to the fisheries in the waters off their coasts in Regional Fisheries Management Councils.,703,567
"New measures for the processing sector seeking to promote continuity, security and stability of supplies , backed by assistance towards infrastructure costs, training packages and maximising the potential to add value to fisheries products.",703,568
A rigorous but fair policing regime enforceable equally in all EU waters.,703,569
Greater emphasis on technical measures to conserve fish stocks.,411,570
Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of research.,411,571
"* Priority to areas with a high degree of fishing dependence , population sparsity and peripherality to be built in to fisheries policy.",703,572
The SNP has allocated an additional £10 million per annum within the Independence Budget to achieve the following strategic objectives:,305,575
Levering the maximum benefit of EU financial assistance to coastal regions by committing an extra £5 million from government resources to structural support and socio-economic measures.,503,576
"Promoting fisheries products and marketing initiatives, stressing the health value of fish with an additional £800,000 spend co-ordinated by a new processing task force.",703,577
An additional £1.6 million for harbour and infrastructure improvements which will leverage additional European funds.,411,578
Improving the effectiveness of research.,411,579
"Scotlands international reputation is as a clean nation, rich in land and water.",501,581
But in reality Scotland is now threatened by a number of environmental hazards.,501,582
We must ensure that Scotlands environment is restored and our people given back a confidence in their surroundings.,501,583
"We must also put in place the best environmental standards, so that we cease to heedlessly waste resources, and instead contribute to the betterment of our planet and those with whom we share it.",501,584
The SNP will retain the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and will ensure that it is independent of the Executive and responsible to the Scottish Parliament.,501,585
"Establish stricter controls on pollution of the atmosphere, sea , inland waters and land.",501,587
"Control, develop and promote the means of environmental rehabilitation",501,588
Establish codes of practice for industry,403,589
"Ensure that there is full public consultation on, and enquiry into, the environmental impact of major projects and government policies.",501,590
"An SNP Government will also promote recycling, and contribute to global environmental protection.",501,591
As part of the overall strategy of government an SNP Government will establish and enshrine National Environmental Targets.,501,592
It goes without saying that no SNP Government would permit Nuclear Reprocessing to take place in Scotland.,501,594
Nuclear reprocessing at Dounreay would end immediately an SNP Government was elected and arrangements would be made for all nuclear material originating furth of Scotland to be returned to their country of origin.,501,595
Materials originating in Scotland will require to be stored in Scotland for as long as environmentally required.,501,596
"However, rather than this determination being seen as a threat to the people of Dounreay, it should be seen as a major opportunity.",504,597
"Employment in clean up, storage and decommissioning will be a long term prospect for many people;",504,598
many others will be employed in a new renewable energy research and development centre which will be established at Dounreay.,504,599
The vital resource of the 20th century has been energy.,408,601
"And in the 21st century energy self sufficiency, still more the ability to export energy or energy sources, will remain of great importance to any nation.",408,602
Scotland is an energy rich nation.,408,614
That fact alone should give us the confidence to face the future in the normal state of independence.,301,615
"But , as part of the bankrupt and out of date Union, we do not use our energy wealth wisely.",410,616
In fact our wealth is being squandered by Westminster.,301,617
An Independent Scotland will secure a division of North Sea oil assets based upon the latitude of 55o 50 north or the international legal principle of equidistance.,107,618
"The Continental Shelf (Jurisdictional) Order already provides such a division, and this order dating from 1968 presently places operations in either an English sector (governed by English Law) or a Scottish sector (governed by Scottish Law).",301,619
"This division has been operated by successive Labour and Tory Governments and places 90% north sea output under Scottish control , a percentage that is growing as the exploitable reserves move north.",301,620
"All existing obligations to oil and gas operators will be honoured, and the SNP envisages no substantive change in the taxation regime so that there can be a clear, stable and continuing climate for the oil industry.",402,621
The policy of an SNP government will be to secure a sustainable and long term oil industry:,416,622
"even present estimates indicate that there is as much oil still to be extracted as has already been extracted, and an SNP government will encourage exploration to increase known reserves and to increase recoverability from existing fields.",410,623
"An SNP Government will seek to add value to Scotlands energy resources , for example by ending the discriminatory pricing policies which mean that landing charges from Scottish gas fields can be anything up to 17 times those south of the border, a situation which has led to gas from the North Sea by-passing Scotland: the Great Gas Robbery.",408,624
"Failure to achieve a satisfactory resolution of this problem will result in an SNP government examining ways in which the gas network, instead of being owned by a single private company could be jointly owned by all companies with an interest in Scottish gas production and supply, with a guiding golden share held for the public good.",413,625
"In addition, development of petro-chemical activity that can build on Scottish land fall of Scottish resources will be encouraged.",402,626
"Whilst the Scottish coal industry has been decimated in recent years, coal still has a part to play in a balanced energy policy.",408,627
"Whilst the SNP wishes to see tighter controls on open cast mining,",403,628
"and a clearer environmental evaluation of each proposed project,",501,629
deep mining also needs to be re-examined with a view to accessing rich seams that have been abandoned too early and without reference to modern technology.,411,630
The SNP is resolutely opposed to Nuclear Power Generation:,501,631
"at present we have neither the ability to make it totally safe, nor the knowledge to be completely certain about long term effects, and long term problems.",501,632
An SNP government will introduce a programme to phase out nuclear generation in Scotland.,501,633
"The length of this phased programme will be planned to take account of new energy sources coming on stream, and on the safe methods of removing nuclear generation from our energy mix.",501,634
There are a number of sources of power in Scotland that are cheaper as well as more environmentally acceptable than Nuclear power and others are developing.,501,635
"To replace nuclear generation, Scotland requires to develop alternative energy sources that are renewable and sustainable.",501,638
"The SNP Budget contains an allocation of funding for this task, and also funding for schemes of energy conservation, which can reduce our demand significantly by reducing heating bills.",501,639
"Scotland needs an integrated transport network, that gives good access to all parts of the country, speeds goods and services,",411,641
and brings the nation closer together.,606,642
"There remains a need for some improvements to the road network, but we must also be mindful of the need to reduce overall car and lorry usage in the years ahead, particularly in our towns and cities.",411,643
"The solution to reduced car usage in particular lies in better public transport, and the SNP will invest in rail services ,",411,644
first of all by returning the Scottish assets of Railtrack into public ownership,413,645
"and then by modernising and electrifying the East Coast Line , commuter routes and branch lines.",411,646
Bus and Coach services are also vital and must be integrated with rail services.,411,647
Effective Bus and Coach transport can assist greatly in easing road congestion and regulation of bus operators should recognise the need to guide service development and delivery to achieve that end as well as to ensure the maintenance of vital links.,411,648
The SNP regards the tolls presently levied by the Skye Bridge as an unacceptable imposition on the people of Skye and as a great disincentive to the creation and preservation of employment.,503,649
"The SNP will , in the immediate term, replace the present tolls with shadow tolls and will take the bridge into public ownership within the first four years of an SNP government.",413,650
"The SNP will also move towards the removal of all tolls on Scottish bridges, and will not introduce tolls on any new or existing bridges or roads.",503,651
"Ferries are vital to Scotlands communications infrastructure and the national Ferry company, Caledonian MacBrayne will be resourced to operate effective , economical services within Scottish waters",411,652
"and will be allowed to compete for services from Scotland, including services from a new East of Scotland ferry port.",411,653
"The SNP will abolish the Air Passenger Duty for the Highlands and Islands , as it unfairly discriminates against Scotlands most remote communities and will modify it for other areas to reflect the cost of the fare rather than imposing a flat rate which works against much needed low cost air transport.",503,654
"In keeping with the need to encourage enterprise and development, we will remove unreasonable restrictions on international freight (the so called fifth freedom)",403,655
"and bearing in mind Scotlands crucial geographical place for Air Traffic Control we will co-operate with our European partners on developing a pan national approach to air space regulation,",411,656
whilst developing and modernising our Oceanic Air Traffic Control centre.,411,657
"Scotland needs more direct air links with the world, and we will work with private operators to make these sustainable,",403,658
as well as assisting Scottish airports to provide high quality services easily accessible to passengers.,403,659
"A final area of opportunity for all of Scotland is the challenge of the global Telecommunications can not only connect parts of Scotland that would otherwise be remote,",411,661
"but it can and will also open Scotland up to the world, and the world to Scotland.",107,662
An SNP Government will strengthen regulation of monopoly suppliers in the Telecommunications Market whilst facilitating greater competition and embracing the drive towards common European and world standards.,403,670
"The SNP will support communications developments in rural areas, particularly in the Highlands and Islands,",411,671
and assist the University of the Highlands and Islands in establishing a world lead in distance learning by the Internet and other means.,506,672
Telecrofting and Telecommuting have a much to offer a country like Scotland and an SNP Government will explore tax incentives for individuals and businesses taking this route.,402,673
Such patterns of working reduce demand on city transport and facilities and should be encouraged.,411,674
"However, whatever policies an SNP Government follows it will not impact upon use of the Internet and global communications unless it also takes a strongly pro-active stance in encouraging domestic, educational and business access to , and use of, the information super highway.",411,675
The 21st century will be the century of information - information as a resource and as an empowering tool.,411,676
"Scots have spent too long following trends, rather than setting them, and an SNP Government will set as a policy objective the commercial support of the Internet so that Scottish companies can access, present themselves through, and provide service on the net",411,677
"and so that individuals and schools can integrate the worlds knowledge base in their own experience, and contribute to it.",411,678
"The rate of involvement in, and access to, the Internet should be regulated by commerce and competition, but the Government has a role in supporting Scottish endeavours in this field,",403,679
and enabling educational use.,506,680
"Scotland as a technology manufacturing base can gain a great deal by seeking always to be part of the cutting edge of technology,",411,681
"and this attitude to the Internet, allied with the encouragement of software manufacture and hardware assembly as core Scottish industries, will be assessed at regular intervals so that Government strategy can lead Scotlands modern potential instead of dragging it down as is the case now.",411,682
"In keeping with an open and positive philosophy on net use and access, no new regulations on censorship or control will be introduced, but support will be given to a ratings system to prevent unwitting access .",403,683
However Scots Law will require to develop means of combating computer fraud and existing law needs to be examined to see if its scope can deal with abuse of individuals by computer means.,605,684
It is time for Scotland to become visible again and to resume a place in the world.,107,688
An SNP Government would wish to make certain that Scotlands traditional openness to Europe and the World again coloured all our international relations.,107,690
"With a secure independent Parliament at home,",301,691
the benefits of international cooperation and full and equal membership of international organisations would greatly strengthen Scotlands ability to defend and promote its interests in a world that shrinks each day.,107,692
"Scotland will be a full member of the European Union, participating fully in the institutions of the Union.",108,693
As a small independent country Scotland can have considerable influence in a Europe which is increasingly dominated by small member states.,301,694
We will have full voting power in the European Council and the Council of Ministers.,301,695
These representatives would be in a position to advocate on Scotlands behalf with the right of veto over any decisions affecting Scotlands vital national interests.,301,696
"This is a far cry from the present powerlessness we endure,",301,697
and some considerable distance from the still powerless observer status that Labour proposes under its devolution plans.,305,698
An SNP Government will use our influence and voting power to gain the maximum benefits for Scottish industry and the Scottish people.,301,699
Our priority would be to enter into the negotiations on the new Common Fisheries Policy to get a better deal for Scotlands fishing industry and to re-orientate the Common Agricultural Policy towards those who work the land.,703,700
We will ensure that rural and urban areas of Scotland receive maximum help from the appropriate EU funds.,301,701
Scotlands representation in the European Parliament would double on Independence and the SNP will support the introduction of a Europe wide voting system for this Parliament to strengthen democracy.,202,702
In the interim we will introduce a proportional system for the first elections after independence.,202,703
We support extending the Parliaments powers to include the proper scrutiny of the Council and the Commission.,202,704
"An Independent Scottish Parliament will elect Scotlands Commissioner and of course Scotland would take its turn at the European Presidency, bringing substantial benefits to the nation.",301,705
"Scotland will require a cost effective , efficient and modern diplomatic presence in some of the worlds capitals.",107,707
"Most small nations do not attempt to emulate the imperial pretensions of the United Kingdom, but instead target their diplomatic effort where it will do most good.",107,708
"Scotlands embassies and consulates will exist to promote Scottish trade and industry,",410,709
look after Scottish citizens,606,710
and represent the best of Scotland to the world.,107,711
"We already pay our share of the UK diplomatic budget, but receive little in return.",305,712
An Independent Scotland would get a much better return for this necessary expenditure.,301,713
"Independence means joining in, not staying separate.",107,721
"The real separatists are those who have put us in our present condition, for they do not allow us to take a full part in anything.",602,722
Scotland will be a full member of the Commonwealth,101,723
"and will use its membership both to promote international co-operation and to market its expertise,",410,724
particularly in the educational field where Scottish Universities and Colleges already have a good reputation.,506,725
Scotland will be a member of the Council of Europe which unites almost all nations on the continent.,107,726
"The Council is best known for its offshoot, the European Court of Human Rights, and an independent Scotland will fully support the Council and the Court and seek to assist in making its judgements and deliberations effective.",107,727
Scotland will be a member of the United Nations.,107,728
The Scottish UN Mission would be one of the two most important Scottish diplomatic postings (the other being the Scottish Permanent Representative to the EU),107,729
"and Scotland in membership of the UN will support peacekeeping, the development of aid, cultural and educational programmes and",107,730
- unlike many members - pay its dues while working for necessary reforms.,107,731
"Finally Scotland will seek to assist in the establishment of an Association of States of the British Isles which will include England, Wales and Ireland.",101,732
This grouping will work together on problems and possibilities that exist in our area and which can be helped by joint action.,101,733
No part of the UK has played such a central role in the defence of the realm as Scotland.,104,735
"Its military and naval traditions are well known, and the professionalism of its service men and women will be an enormous asset to an independent state.",104,736
At the date of independence all serving service personnel from Scotland will be given the opportunity to transfer to the Scottish Defence Forces.,301,737
The same guarantee will apply to all MOD personnel serving in Scotland.,301,738
"Conscription is neither necessary, desirable nor anticipated.",105,739
"Indeed, as modern defence rejects conscription and as it is more costly in many ways, conscription would be a backward looking cul de sac.",105,740
"Because of Scotlands geographic position, vital assets and international perspective, a modern, efficient and appropriate defence structure can be established that will be professional, well resourced and well targeted to its tasks.",104,741
"The Scottish Army will require infantry battalions, a commando battalion, an armoured regiment, and the requisite combat support and combat supply service units.",104,742
"Stationed at existing barracks the Army will require 9000 regulars, 16000 regular reservists, 7000 national reserves and 2000 MOD civilians.",104,743
Traditional Scottish regiments will be restored wherever possible.,104,744
The Scottish Navy will require both surface and submarine craft based at Faslane and Rosyth with a berthing base at Lerwick.,104,745
"It will have 5000 regulars, 2000 regular reserves and 600 national reserves as well as 5000 MoD personnel.",104,746
The Scottish Air Force will have both fixed wing and helicopter capability.,104,747
"The main bases will be Leuchars, Kinloss, and Lossiemouth.",104,750
"There will be 6000 regulars , 3650 regular reservists, 400 national reserves and 2850 MoD civilians.",104,751
"The Scottish Defence Forces will prioritise joint services training, and support and command structures will be developed to avoid needless and costly duplication of effort.",303,752
A culture of inter service co-operation will be central to the Forces philosophy.,104,753
"The traditions of Scottish units, built up over many years, will be fostered and maintained in the Defence Forces.",104,754
"An Independent Scotland will contribute to, and benefit from, international co-operation especially in peace keeping, training, and conflict resolution.",106,755
"In addition to the SNPs support for an EU Common Security and Defence Policy we would participate in the Western European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and the Partnership for Peace.",106,756
A Peacekeeping college will be established in Scotland to instruct SDF and foreign personnel in the theory and practice of peace keeping and seek to place Scotland in the forefront of international peacekeeping efforts.,106,757
The SNP have a long standing objection to nuclear weapons.,105,758
"We will negotiate a phased but complete withdrawal of Trident from the Clyde and invest our savings from this costly , deadly and unnecessary nuclear deterrent in conventional defence as well as in other priorities including health and education.",105,759
An independent Scotland will inherit a treaty obligation to NATO.,105,760
However our opposition to nuclear defence will make our continued participation in nuclear alliances difficult.,105,761
We therefore propose to negotiate a phased withdrawal from NATO,105,762
but will retain military co-operation with NATO nations as a result of our other proposed international involvements already mentioned above.,104,763
Defence Industries in Scotland will be free to carry on their businesses in cooperation with firms outside Scotland.,401,764
"Their end user certifications will be subject to stringent scrutiny, but at the same time Scottish firms will have priority in tendering for SDF contracts within the constraints of EU legislation.",412,765
"Refit of the SDF navy will take place at Rosyth,",104,766
"and the rolling programme of equipment replacement should enhance the position of Scottish defence contractors who will, at last, have a national force to attend to",104,767
without being totally dependent on the lottery of UK defence procurement procedures run from distant and often deaf Whitehall.,305,768
"The SNP will also promote Defence Diversification , with funding already allocated in the SNP Budget.",104,769
"The highly skilled Scottish defence manufacturing companies, and their workers, will have a brighter future both in supplying the SDF and in being encouraged and assisted to expand their abilities and markets.",104,770
"It has been, and remains, a matter of shame that the UK, one of the richer nations of the world, is so miserly when it comes to international aid.",602,772
The UK presently falls far short of the agreed international target of 0.7% of GDP to be spent on international aid.,602,773
Indeed further recent cuts have taken the UKs GDP share to below 0.3%.,602,774
"The SNP has budgeted for a steady growth from this low point (which we shall inherit), with the aim of reaching 0.7% in six years.",107,775
"This period will allow the development of the necessary infrastructure, both governmental and voluntary, to meet the challenge of overseas aid and relief work.",107,776
"Small countries in Europe lead the way in aid, relief and international assistance.",107,783
"Sweden, Norway and Denmark are good examples of different models that work well.",107,784
Scotland can be amongst them and with independence it will be.,301,785
This manifesto has laid out the main proposals of the SNP for the creation of an independent nation once again,301,794
"and the sensitive, compassionate and forward looking governance of that nation which the SNP believe can be delivered.",305,795
But plans would be worthless without the resources to pay for them.,305,796
"And because the SNP aspire to govern Scotland, we also plan in detail for our country.",305,797
That is why we publish with this manifesto a fully costed budget for the first four years of independence.,301,798
That budget takes account of the riches of Scotland and of the extra resources we can generate by a new approach to business and individual taxation.,410,799
"It lays out those areas in which we can re-order spending , switching resources from needless projects like Trident, to needed projects like new schools and hospitals.",504,800
YES WE CAN!,301,807
On the 1st of May you will have the opportunity of using your vote to choose Scotlands future.,202,811
"The SNP has laid out in this manifesto its plans and proposals, and - alone amongst the political parties - has clearly costed them .",305,812
"Also alone amongst the political parties, the Scottish National Party is offering a programme made for Scotland in Scotland:",301,813
a programme that uses Scottish resources and Scottish principles to solve Scottish problems.,301,814
Independence is the normal status for nations.,301,815
"More than half of the nations of the world are smaller than Scotland, and most are much poorer.",107,816
"Yet they have chosen independence, and not one would wish to give it up.",301,817
We can do so too - together.,606,818
YES WE CAN,301,820
Yes We Can be free:,301,821
Yes We Can be independent:,301,822
Yes We Can pay our way in the world.,107,823
"And yes, we must!",301,824
The SNP stands for Scotland.,601,4
We stand for Independence and,301,5
we stand for the people -all the people - who live in our rich country.,305,6
At the Westminster election the people of Scotland have a choice.,305,7
A choice between the Scottish National Party that stands for Scotland,601,8
and which campaigns for Independence,301,9
or the London parties which have failed our country for too long.,305,10
The election of SNP MPs to the Westminster Parliament is a vote for Scotland and a vote for Independence.,601,12
"A vote for MPs committed to win Independence,",301,13
and who will work to bring about Independence as quickly as possible.,301,14
It is also a vote to win more powers for the Scottish Parliament and,301,15
a vote for MPs who will always put Scotland first.,301,16
"The more SNP MPs elected to Westminster, the stronger the case for a referendum on Independence.",301,17
A majority of SNP MPs will trigger a referendum.,301,18
This means our country gets the chance to vote for Independence -,301,19
to complete the powers of our Parliament -,301,20
in a democratic referendum.,301,21
"In advance of that referendum, all SNP MPs will put the case for more and complete powers for the Scottish Parliament from day one in the Westminster Parliament.",202,22
To be effective the Scottish Parliament must have the ability to take the key decisions that matter to the people of this country.,301,23
SNP MPs will argue for what is in the Scottish interest at all times,601,24
and will campaign strongly against all anti-Scottish legislation and measures at Westminster.,601,25
The SNP has no split loyalty;,601,26
"we work first, last and always for the Scottish interest.",601,27
"The more SNP MPs elected to the Westminster Parliament, the more we can do for Scotland.",601,29
And every vote for the SNP is a vote for the strongest voice for our country.,305,30
Each and every SNP MP will go to Westminster with three key aims.,305,31
"Drive Scotland forward to Independence,",301,32
completing the powers of the Scottish  Parliament -,301,33
"The stronger our voice, the stronger we can be in making the case for Independence",301,34
delivered by a democratic referendum.,202,35
Deliver the best deal for Scotland -,601,36
"the larger the SNP presence in the House of Commons, the better chance we have of making sure that Scotland gets the best deal.",601,37
Protect Scotland from the worst failings of Westminster rule -,301,38
"the more SNP MPs, the greater the chance we have of stopping the next fuel tax hike",301,39
or the next attack on Scottish public spending.,301,40
"Independence can release the energy, potential and opportunities needed to transform our country and",301,42
"to build a vibrant, exciting future for our children.",301,43
"We have a vision of Scotland that is a just, caring and enterprising country",301,44
where individuals are able to get on in the world regardless of where they have come from.,301,45
We believe strongly that there is a modern role for Scotlands democratic government as a keystone in building a modern Scottish society and economy.,301,46
"It is through our government that we can pool our collective resources as a society and focus them on delivering a healthy,",301,47
"well-educated people,",301,48
living in a 21 st century environment and,301,49
cared for in times of need.,501,50
Scotland already has a Parliament but that Parliament has very limited powers.,301,51
We stand for completing the powers of our Parliament ,301,52
removing powers over issues that remain in London,301,53
and bringing them back to Scotland and,301,54
equipping the Scottish people with the same powers as every other normal country in the world.,301,55
We stand for giving the people of Scotland the chance to vote for the power to decide where they spend the resources and revenue of Scotland.,301,56
To decide the amount of investment in public services they,301,57
want and the amount of benefits they wish to allocate to those in need.,301,58
All those powers are with London at present,301,59
and we stand for transferring them to the Scottish Parliament.,301,60
Government from London will never deliver what we stand for,301,61
and what the people of Scotland demand.,301,62
The SNP stands to change that.,301,63
Scotland has a wealth of potential as a country.,301,64
"We have all the ingredients to make a success of our economy and our society,",301,65
but we need the confidence in ourselves to make that success happen.,301,66
Normal status in the world is what Independence is about.,301,67
We stand for a modern vision to transform Scotland with 21 st Century Independence.,301,68
Scotland is a wealthy country and can afford to invest more in public services.,504,70
"However, we need to ensure that we can invest in the long term by using the benefits of Scotlands wealth of resources.",301,71
"Scotland will send £7.7 billion to Westminster more than we will receive back over the two years to 2002, as we published in Scotlands 21 st Century Opportunity - Government Expenditures & Revenues in Scotland 2000-2002.",301,72
We will establish the Scottish Fund for Future Generations (SFFG) as a means of securing that long-term investment.,504,73
By committing our surplus oil revenues to the SFFG we will lock up the benefits of years of plenty forever.,504,74
This fund will produce a sustainable stream of income for investment from the depletion of scarce natural resources.,416,75
The extent of this income will vary with the revenues committed and the rates of return on investment achieved.,416,76
The investment in the SFFG could be £4.9 billion in the next year alone.,504,77
The income from that one years investment could in turn be worth in excess of £390 million a year in-perpetuity assuming an 8 per cent benchmark real rate of return.,504,78
That money would be available for reinvestment in public services on a sustainable basis.,416,79
The income from the fund is projected to top £1 billion a year after five years and could reach £5 billion per year in time.,504,80
Norway is already achieving income levels of this order after only five years of operating such a fund.,504,81
We will also establish the Scottish Trust for Public Investment (STPI).,504,82
This will target low cost investment into public infrastructure by competing costly PFI/PPP financed projects out of the market.,504,83
"By operating on a not for profit basis, spreading risk and gathering expertise under one roof,",504,84
"together with a secure government income stream,",414,85
the STPI could cut the cost of capital compared to PFI in half.,504,86
This will release a massive amount of resources for re-investment into public service infrastructure.,504,87
The Scottish National Party believes that an Independent Scotland must have a written Constitution that clearly enshrines the rights and responsibilities of all those who choose to live in Scotland.,202,90
"In the context of EU citizenship, the SNP have an open and inclusive approach to Scottish citizenship.",108,91
"The automatic right of citizenship will be open to all those living in Scotland,",602,92
all those born in Scotland and,602,93
all those with a parent born in Scotland.,602,94
All others are free to apply.,602,95
"With Independence,",301,96
"the Queen and her successors will remain as Head of State of Scotland, as defined within the written Constitution,",203,97
subject to the democratic consent of the people in a referendum.,202,98
The Scottish National Party supports the introduction of proportional representation at all levels of government.,202,99
Public confidence in the quango system is at an all time low.,202,101
This is exacerbated by the failure of quangos and,202,102
ministers to be held accountable when they deliver poor performance.,202,103
We will examine the role and effectiveness of the current range of quangos with a view to abolishing the excessive number of quangos operating in Scotland,202,104
and to replace the quango state with a democratic state.,202,105
We will introduce measures to increase the control of the Scottish Parliament over appointments to,202,106
and performance of those quangos that will remain.,202,107
"In particular, we support the current Private Members Bill in the Scottish Parliament regarding scrutiny of Scotlands quangos.",202,108
Independence will provide job security and new opportunities for civil servants -,704,110
"within the Scottish Executive,",704,111
Executive Agencies,704,112
and those UK departments employing staff within Scotland - to advance to the top of their profession.,704,113
The SNP believes in the right of free access to higher education.,506,115
"We support the complete abolition of tuition fees,",506,116
whether these are due up front or paid back after graduation.,506,117
As resources allow we will build on existing maintenance grant provision to re-create a decent maintenance grant,506,118
and remove the dependence on student loans.,506,119
"We are supportive of the additional recommendations of the Cubie Report,",506,120
in particular those relating to the restoration of state benefits,504,121
and our Westminster MPs will argue for this.,504,122
The SNP has a long-standing commitment to the reduction of the voting age and,202,124
would like young people from the age of 16 to have voting entitlement.,202,125
The SNP would progress towards full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.,706,126
The establishment of a powerful and independent Childrens Commissioner for Scotland is fully supported by the SNP,706,127
and is essential in promoting awareness of childrens rights and,706,128
challenging individual breaches of rights.,706,129
As part of our commitment to family life we will support agencies which offer assistance to couples seeking counselling,603,130
and help during times of difficulty.,603,131
The SNP wants all Scots to fulfil their potential.,506,133
We must draw out of each generation the very best that they have to give to their society and to themselves.,506,134
"We must value education for its own sake,",506,135
"but also because enterprise, creativity and ambition all flow from the results of successful and continuing education.",401,136
The SNP will help Scottish education to become internationally respected once again.,506,137
We will do that by taking education out of the political battleground,506,138
and bringing forward proposals to depressurise a system that has been over stressed by central prescription.,301,139
"We would impose a moratorium on further change in the classroom and in educational administration until we have established an Education Convention,",506,141
chaired by the Education Minister and comprising a wide range of representatives from across Scotland and from throughout education.,202,142
"It will have the responsibility of debating policy proposed by Government prior to the legislative process,",506,143
and on making recommendations for implementation,506,144
after it has been approved by Parliament.,506,145
It will compliment the work of Government and Parliament.,202,146
The Convention will be established in the first year of an SNP government.,506,147
Thereafter the SNP will bring forward for pre and post legislative consultation through the Convention three major priority initiatives:,506,148
"We will introduce a phased reduction of Primary 1,",506,149
2,506,150
"and 3 class sizes to 18 or below,",506,151
initially targeting areas of social deprivation.,705,152
"This will be done by increased investment in teachers,",506,153
schools,506,154
and materials.,506,155
We will end publication of selective information that leads to the compilation of misleading league tables which are increasingly seen as disruptive to the process of learning,303,156
and which produce no benefit for young people themselves.,706,157
We will also critically examine the present externally imposed target setting for,301,158
"schools and bring about a reduction in the burden of assessment on young people,",706,159
Teachers,506,160
and schools.,506,161
We will develop a system in which the professional judgement of teachers is the central element,506,162
and in which powers abrogated to others in these matters will be returned to the classroom.,506,163
We will start on a major programme of school refurbishment and,506,164
"repair, using the innovative opportunity created by the STPI that will enable us to do more work,",506,165
more efficiently.,506,166
The SNP is committed to the full implementation of the McCrone settlement,506,168
and this will greatly assist in developing a new atmosphere in Scotlands schools.,506,169
We will re-examine the duties of parents with the aim of ensuring that they play a full partnership role with schools and take responsibility for their children.,603,170
"We shall also bring forward changes in formal parental representation in schools,",202,171
replacing the present School Board structure with new arrangements taking account of the already expressed views of COSLA and others.,506,172
"We will also pursue other measures, including:- restructuring Her Majestys Inspectorate to consist of a small core of professional managers supported in actual inspection by secondees from schools;",303,173
introduction of measures that will ease the transition between nursery and primary school;,506,174
delivery of appropriate and effective training for teachers in information and communication technology;,506,175
"creation of new guidelines on school closures, with a presumption against closure of rural schools except in clearly specified circumstances;",506,176
and production of high quality teaching materials,506,177
"on Scottish history, language and literature.",605,178
We will place a duty in law to provide Gaelic medium education,607,179
where there is reasonable demand and developing Gaelic medium provision in the primary and secondary sectors.,607,180
We will also conduct a legislative review of the provision of school transport.,506,181
We support positive steps to ensure that the particular needs of Catholic schools are recognised in professional training and development,603,182
and that the contribution of Catholic schools to the diversity and richness of the Scottish educational scene is fully realised.,603,183
We will ensure that the needs of ethnic minority groups are met in mainstream schooling,705,184
and that anti-racism is a core element in a childs growing understanding of our multicultural society.,607,185
Other measures will include developing the concept of Community;,606,186
enhancing the role of community education;,506,187
assisting teachers to impart the essential elements of citizenship education through their professional development;,606,188
recognising that mainstream schools with an inclusive orientation are,606,189
the most effective means of meeting the needs of all learners who share an equal entitlement to be there;,506,190
properly supporting moves towards more inclusive education for those with special needs;,506,191
providing support and back up for teachers in difficult circumstances in the classroom;,704,192
and providing back up where indiscipline and truancy are significant problems.,605,193
We will create an economic climate to end unemployment.,408,195
"Our philosophy is based on building on Scotlands strengths,",601,196
and tackling the weaknesses that inhibit growth.,410,197
"More than anything, we are determined to create a specific Scottish economic policy suited to the economic profile of our nation.",301,198
Our programme of infrastructure investment through the Scottish Trust for Public Investment,411,200
"will give Scots businesses improved access to world markets through a modern and reliable road,",402,201
"rail,",411,202
sea and,411,203
air network.,411,204
We will ensure Scotland does not get by-passed by the digital revolution by ensuring that Scotland has direct access to the internet and,411,205
broadband capacity throughout the country.,411,206
"And our focus on reskilling Scotland will work to ensure that one of the key ingredients of a successful economy, a highly educated, flexible and skilled workforce, is in place to allow both the growth of indigenous enterprises,",411,207
"but also to encourage the relocation of high-skill, value-added international investors to our country.",402,208
Economic development agencies must become more focused,303,209
and less bureaucratic.,201,210
They must be more accessible and less regulatory.,402,211
Their aim is to facilitate and add value to indigenous and incoming business.,303,212
They should stimulate not suffocate.,402,213
"Finally, because we believe in Scotland, because we stand for Scotland,",601,214
"we will be best placed to sell Scotland as a marketplace,",408,215
as a holiday destination,408,216
and as a key export partner.,408,217
"We will ensure that Scotlands businesses get better and wider representation across the world,",402,218
and that every effort is made to promote Scotland as a world beating business,402,219
and tourist centre.,402,220
"To this end, we will bring the tourist agency into Scotlands enterprise network.",402,221
Scotlands tourism industry has been under-valued,408,223
and the Scottish Executive has completely mishandled attempts to revitalise the industry.,303,224
"A confident and quality industry aiming to achieve an ambitious expansion of business levels can be achieved, but only with the correct policy direction.",402,225
The two key strategic aims in developing the industry must be to market the product,402,226
and make access cheaper and simpler.,402,227
The recent structural changes to the Scottish Tourist Board and Visit Scotland recognise that change is required.,303,228
"However, much more remains to be done.",303,229
"Fundamentally, the organisation must move away from seeing itself as a regulatory body to being a marketing body, which sells the product of a holiday or break in Scotland, at home and abroad.",401,230
More effective marketing and the direct promotion of Scotland to replace the role of the British Tourist Authority is required.,401,231
We need to ensure that we maximise our profile in our key areas,408,232
not disperse our resources in peripheral ones.,408,233
Access to Scotland is fundamental.,411,234
The lack of a Scottish gateway airport is a clear impediment.,411,235
"Hence, there is a requirement to ensure that our marketing also dovetails with a transport strategy.",411,236
The SNP will campaign for better transport links for visitors to enter Scotland.,411,237
"The SNP at Westminster will press for devolution of the New Deal to Scotland,",301,239
and in government will refocus the millions of pounds invested in this programme to create a Better Deal by targeting people living in Scotlands job black spots,701,240
"and providing additional training, support and encouragement for long-term and",701,241
youth unemployed.,701,242
"This will come as part of a project of national reskilling,",701,243
and will assist those who too often slip off the statistics and out of the New Deal programme.,701,244
The SNP has long supported a minimum wage set at half male median earnings.,701,246
SNP MPs at Westminster and an SNP government would support an immediate increase of the minimum wage to £4.36 for all Scots regardless of their age.,701,247
This is a 16°k increase on current levels compared to Labours proposal of a 9°k increase.,701,248
We would aim to achieve a similar increase for the following year.,701,249
We would end age discrimination and the minimum wage would apply for all Scots regardless of their age.,503,250
The lowest paid young Scots working a 40-hour week would gain £2350 a year extra under SNP plans.,701,251
Workers over 21 on the minimum wage would see an increase in income of £1350 a year.,701,252
Any such moves would follow discussion with employers and trades unions about implementation.,405,253
"Recognising the possible impact of a higher minimum wage on small businesses in Scotland, the SNPs review of the tax system will develop measures to reduce employment costs for small businesses using the increased revenue that will accrue to the Exchequer from higher tax income resulting from a higher minimum wage,",403,254
"In the last UK Parliament, it was the SNP who stood for Scotlands trades unions by pressing the case for fair ballots for trade union recognition in the workplace,",701,256
"in contrast to the governments system, which meant a majority of votes did not mean recognition.",701,257
Our support for Scotlands trades unions will continue.,701,258
We will guarantee the rights of trades unions,701,259
and the rights of representation for workers through a statutory Charter of Trade Union Rights.,701,260
We support the EU Directive on collective redundancies,701,261
and will argue strongly for the ratification of other employee involvement laws.,701,262
"The SNP stands for a clean, safe and sustainable environment in Scotland.",416,264
"With so many key industries - agriculture,",501,265
tourism,501,266
"and fisheries - dependent on Scotlands environmental image,",501,267
maintaining and protecting our natural environment must be central to any governments priorities.,501,268
An SNP government will strive to ensure that Scotland becomes a world leader in securing a sustainable environment,416,269
"and quality of life for all,",301,270
recognising that local action can have global impact and,501,271
that environmental problems do not respect national boundaries.,107,272
We will contribute towards international climate change targets.,501,273
We oppose the UK government climate change levy,501,274
and have particular concerns about its impact on hydroelectric power.,501,275
We will undertake an evaluation of the risks from climate change,501,276
and will produce a strategy to address these risks.,501,277
As a first step to securing this objective an SNP government will commission a State of the Nation Environmental Audit to assess Scotlands current position.,501,278
"From this we will establish a National Environment Plan (NEP),",501,279
which will set stretching standards,501,280
"and targets to meet Scotlands international obligations,",107,281
"and where appropriate, surpass these objectives.",501,282
"In the short term, at Westminster, we will press for SEPA to be given statutory monitoring powers over military facilities in Scotland so that there is proper environmental regulation of MoD practices such as the dumping of depleted uranium in the Solway Firth.",501,283
"In government the SNP will seek to ensure Scotland produces 12% of all its energy requirements from renewable sources by 2010,",501,284
including 25% of its electricity.,501,285
We will not build any more nuclear power stations.,501,286
Existing facilities will be decommissioned at the end of their economic or technical capacity.,501,287
"Dounreay will be supported as an international centre of decommissioning,",501,288
allowing Scotland to export its expertise.,107,289
"We are committed to the development of a resource efficient culture in Scotland, supporting the key concepts of the ""six Rs"" - Refuse, Reduce, Re-use, Refurbish, Recycle, Recover.",416,290
"The SNP is committed to the Precautionary and Polluter Pays Principles,",501,291
and in government will introduce an integrated system of pollution prevention and control.,501,292
"As part of our Comprehensive Tax Review, we will examine the system of Landfill Tax Credits.",501,293
An SNP government will undertake an immediate review of the water industry's financial arrangements bringing to an end sky-high increases in water charges and a halt to backdoor privatisation.,412,295
Suitable protection for low-income households,701,296
and the voluntary sector will be introduced.,606,297
The three water quangos will be given a more democratic and accountable structure.,202,298
"An exemption will be sought from the Competition Act, to allow the industry to cope with the significant challenges that it already faces,",402,299
and consider the implications of competition.,403,300
The SNP recognises that those who work in the health service are already committed to delivering real improvements,704,302
and we support them in their efforts.,704,303
We are also supportive of many of the initiatives published in the Scottish Health Plan.,504,304
The SNPs policy platform is not an alternative to the initiatives that are already planned or underway.,504,305
What it does is identify key areas where the SNP believes that government could and should go further.,504,306
The SNP believes that the National Health Service is too important to be a political football.,504,308
"We will establish a National Health Care Commission (NHCC),",504,309
"chaired by the Minister for Health & Community Care with cross party representation of MSPs, representatives of the health profession and unions together with members of the wider community.",405,310
The Commission will be charged with setting the strategic direction for NHS Scotland,504,311
and given a central role in the drive to end postcode treatment.,504,312
"The NHCC will be instrumental in raising morale of health professionals,",704,313
"which is at an all time low,",704,314
not least in the primary care sector.,704,315
A recent survey of GPs in Scotland found that nearly 80% did not feel included in changes in the NHS.,704,316
That must change if there is to be a genuine partnership approach to improving our health service.,704,317
The Commission will also examine how local healthcare co-operatives can best be empowered to deliver real improvements.,504,318
Making Scotland a healthier place to live is at the heart of our policy platform.,504,320
Free fruit in schools.,504,321
We will target policies and resources in improving the health of Scotlands children and encouraging in our young people -,504,322
and hopefully their parents,504,323
-a culture of healthy eating.,504,324
We will extend on a national basis the practice of a few local authorities of providing free fruit in schools,504,325
"and will provide, during term time, a free daily portion of fruit to every primary school pupil in Scotland.",504,326
2.  Healthier school meals.,504,327
- which for many children is the main meal of the day,706,329
- to ensure that the food children eat at school meets minimum nutritional standards.,504,330
The SNP is committed to restoring a system in which access to health care is determined by a professional assessment of clinical need,504,332
and not by the lottery of a patients residence.,503,333
The SNP pledges to end postcode treatment within our first term in government.,504,334
No patient will be denied access to a drug or treatment that has been positively assessed by the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS).,504,335
The SNP will substantially increase the budget of the HTBS to enable it to expand its workload,504,336
and increase the number of assessments that it carries out each year.,504,337
The findings of the HTBS will be binding on health boards.,504,338
The NHCC will have a central role in the drive to end postcode treatment.,503,339
It will be for the Commission to identify instances where the care and treatment of patients in any area falls significantly below that in other areas.,503,340
The NHCC will be empowered to work pro-actively with the relevant health bodies to ensure that effective action is taken to bring the quality of care up to acceptable standards.,303,341
The SNP in government will re-introduce free dental check ups for everyone in Scotland.,504,343
The SNP will act to end the unfairness inherent in the prescription charges system.,503,345
"We will freeze the level of prescription charges immediately,",504,346
"and establish an independent, short-term working party to review the level of charges and the categories of exemption.",303,347
We support and will continue the drive to set and maintain national standards of clinical excellence.,504,349
We will take action to ensure that patients are treated as quickly and as close to home as is possible,504,350
"and clinically appropriate,",504,351
"and in settings that are clean,",504,352
"modern,",504,353
properly staffed,504,354
and well equipped.,504,355
Our early priorities will be to invest in reequipping NHS Scotland,504,356
and tackling staff shortages.,504,357
The SNP is determined to make significant progress by delivering real investment in our first term.,504,359
"Over the next twenty-five years, the NHS will spend nearly £3 billion under PFI contracts,",504,360
to service capital investment of only £ 1 billion.,504,361
"Through the STPI, we will lever in considerably more investment to NHS Scotland for the same or greater scale of commitment.",504,362
We will carry out an audit of the age and effectiveness of existing hospital equipment,504,363
and use the results of the audit to target capital investment to ensure that our hospitals are at the cutting edge of medical technology.,504,364
"The SNP will invest an extra £4 million in a ""Clean Hospitals Fund"" to enable an immediate clean up of Scotlands hospitals.",504,366
"We will take action with the aim of employing at least 1,500 more nurses in the health service.",504,368
We will also launch a nurse recruitment campaign to encourage young people to enter the profession,504,369
and qualified nurses who have left it to return.,504,370
"With the investment that we are promising in hospital buildings,",504,372
medical equipment,504,373
"and nurses, we believe that maximum waiting times for all inpatient treatment can be cut by half in our first term in office.",504,374
The SNP are committed to free personal care for all elderly people who need it.,504,376
The SNP remains committed to paying personal care costs in full and,504,377
will do so on taking office if Labour continues to let Scotlands pensioners down.,504,378
The SNP stands for Scotland in Europe.,108,380
The Scottish National Party believes that membership of the European Union will give Scotland real advantages.,108,381
"It will secure for Scotland a voice at the heart of Europe, with full membership of the important decision and policy-making bodies.",108,382
"We support the present confederal union in Europe,",108,383
and reject moves to a European Super State.,110,384
"We support steps towards enhanced co-operation in defence,",108,385
"foreign affairs,",108,386
trade and,108,387
"the environment,",108,388
"but reject abandoning national vetoes on issues relating to natural resources,",110,389
taxation and,110,390
the constitution.,110,391
"We seek a stronger commitment to subsidiarity, with responsibilities returned to member states in areas such as coastal fisheries under the Common Fisheries Policy.",703,392
Sharing of sovereignty should be restricted to defined areas where it brings clear benefits.,108,393
"We see advantages in Scottish membership of the single currency,",108,394
"but this can only be achieved when the economic conditions are correct,",110,395
when an acceptable exchange rate is delivered,110,396
and where public consent has been given in a referendum.,202,397
The SNP welcomes an enlarged Union.,108,398
This will give greater weight and prominence to small and medium sized nations.,108,399
"Clearly, after Nice, Scotland will have significantly greater influence in the European Union as an independent nation than as part of the United Kingdom.",108,400
"At present, Scotland is represented only in the European Parliament -",108,401
"but as part of the UK, we have only half as many MEPs as Denmark or Finland, countries with similar populations.",110,402
The Treaty of Nice would further reduce MEPs for Scotland within the UK -,110,403
but provide a better deal for Scotland with Independence.,202,404
An independent Scotland under the Nice Treaty would have its full quota of 13 MEPs,108,405
and seven weighted votes in the Council of,108,406
Ministers plus a member of the European Commission,108,407
- compared to no votes and no Commissioner within the UK.,301,408
On Independence we will negotiate the safe removal of Trident from Scotland,105,410
and an independent Scotland,301,411
"will work to eliminate nuclear,",105,412
biological,105,413
and chemical weapons world-wide.,105,414
Pre-independence we will continue to be part of the coalition against Trident in the UK.,105,415
"But while we have the risk of Trident, we should get the benefit of the jobs at Rosyth,",408,416
and we will fight any government proposals to remove refitting work from Scotland.,408,417
SNP MPs will oppose any involvement in a possible US National Missile Defence Programme,105,418
believing it to be unwise and damaging to international relations between east and west.,107,419
The SNP stands for co-operation in conventional defence.,104,420
"We will contribute to international security,",104,421
"conflict resolution,",106,422
peacekeeping,106,423
and disaster,107,424
"and humanitarian relief through the European Union Common Foreign & Security Policy and European Rapid Reaction Force,",107,425
"the OSCE, EAPC/PfP and the UN.",107,426
An independent Scotland will inherit a treaty obligation to NATO.,104,427
However our opposition to nuclear defence will make our continued participation in nuclear alliances difficult.,105,428
We therefore propose to negotiate a phased withdrawal from NATO,105,429
but will retain military co-operation with NATO nations through a variety of international involvements.,107,430
"An SNP government will promote the study of the theory and practice of peacekeeping,",106,431
and will make its skills available to Scottish Defence Force personnel,106,432
and to the forces of,107,433
democratically governed nations.,202,434
"The priority of the Scottish Defence Force (SDF), in partnership with Scotland's neighbours, will be to safeguard the land, sea and air space of Scotland.",104,435
"SDF training and equipment will reflect that,",104,436
as well as the need for rapid deployment overseas.,103,437
Some units will have specialised training for humanitarian and disaster relief operations.,107,438
The SDF will initially be equipped with Scotland's negotiated share of UK defence resources.,104,439
"Service and pension conditions will be equal to those of the UK forces, with some enhancements.",104,440
The SDF will be an all-professional force supported by part time volunteers,104,441
and jobs will be open to all who meet the appropriate standards.,701,442
All MoD civilians working in Scotland at Independence will be able to remain in the Scottish MoD or Scottish civil service.,704,443
"Defence industries will be subject to end user scrutiny to ensure that Scotland only exports arms to legitimate sources,",105,444
and not through third parties to the worst regimes.,105,445
While Scotland is in the UK the SNP will work to ensure that Scotland obtains a fair share of defence expenditure.,503,446
"Bases at Kinloss, Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Prestwick, Faslane and all barracks and training areas (regular and reserve) will be fully utilised by the SDF",104,447
and consideration may be given to using regular and reserve sites that have been shut by the UK.,104,448
Additional accommodation for specialised equipment or personnel may be built on any of the above sites.,104,449
An Independent Scotland will,301,451
"play a full role in the international community through its membership of the European Union,",108,452
the Commonwealth,107,453
and the United Nations.,107,454
"We will always promote Scottish interests internationally,",109,455
ensuring productive and harmonious relationships with the other countries of the world.,107,456
"Where UK embassies are about status, Scottish Embassies would be about business.",401,457
"The SNP would establish a commercially focussed presence for Scotland in the major commercial and population centres of the world by amalgamating the foreign representation of Locate in Scotland, Scottish Trade International and VisitScotland into External Affairs Offices of the Government of Scotland.",107,458
Scotlands External Affairs department would operate on a budget no greater than the current spending by the Scottish Executive and its Agencies on overseas representation and our population share of Foreign & Commonwealth Office spending.,107,459
The SNP has a long-standing commitment to raise Scotlands international aid budget to UN recommended levels.,107,461
"We are committed to the cancellation of Third World Debt and poverty eradication,",107,462
and accept the 2015 International Development Targets.,107,463
We would seek to reduce Third World debt by pushing for reform of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to allow for speedier and wider reaching relief to all countries that are in need.,107,464
International Aid will be in the form of grants or very low interest loans to avoid increasing the debt burden.,107,465
"The SNP does not believe in ""Aid for Trade"" and would accordingly untie all its aid programmes so that they would not be reliant on buying from Scottish firms, since this may not be appropriate for the recipient country.",107,466
"An SNP government will establish and fund a voluntary secretariat - ""Aid from Scotland"" -",107,467
"to coordinate a unified approach and provide a single point of contact for Scotland's aid agencies,",107,468
ensuring a quick response to global emergencies.,107,469
The SNP has consistently argued for legislative oversight of Scottish broadcasting to be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.,301,471
"The SNP is keen to see a ""dash for digital"" so that the changeover can establish Scotland's place in the forefront of technological development",411,472
and we believe the government must work in partnership with providers to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital revolution.,411,473
"The SNP anticipates a growing together of broadcasting, computer and mobile technology",411,474
and will support and assist those entrepreneurs who seek to make such technologies benefit our nation and the world.,411,475
"We will seek a presence in the UK,",301,476
European,301,477
"and global media,",301,478
to continue to campaign for the progressive devolution of powers over budget and,301,479
"schedule to BBC Scotland, and to argue for the Scottish Six.",301,480
"While realistic about the inevitability of change in the rules on cross media ownership, we will continue to seek a strong Scottish presence in worldwide and democratic markets.",601,481
"We see an important role for sport,",502,483
"not only in tackling issues relating to youth crime,",605,484
but also in ensuring improved health for people in Scotland.,504,485
The SNP would like to see resources currently available for sport focused more on local and community sporting activities.,301,486
"The SNP supports the creation of Football Academies,",502,487
and would use existing funds to assist in the creation of a national network of such bodies.,502,488
We will bid for the 2008 European Football Championships to be based in Scotland.,502,489
"The SNP will radically reform the Scottish Arts Council,",502,491
first of all by providing direct funding to the National companies,502,492
(including a new national theatre).,502,493
"From existing resources, we will establish a ""Scottish Academy"" to encourage excellence and to bring forward new talent",502,494
and we will considerably increase funding for traditional Scottish arts.,601,495
We will introduce a Scottish Lottery to provide money for good causes including the arts.,502,496
The SNP continues to campaign for secure status for Gaelic as one of the key measures that will assist in supporting and reviving the language.,607,498
We must put in place measures that stop the decline in the number of Gaelic speakers,607,499
and create a new generation of Gaelic speakers.,607,500
This means not only a much wider provision of Gaelic medium education,607,501
"but also the development of new opportunities for adults to become fluent Gaelic speakers,",607,502
and new ways of accessing such opportunities.,607,503
"The SNP would support measures to improve the teaching of Scots language and literature in schools,",607,505
and would encourage all forms of the media in positive promotion and usage of the language.,607,506
"Until Independence,",301,507
the SNP will keep up the pressure on the UK Government to fulfil their obligations to the Scots Language,607,508
under Part II of the European Charter,108,509
"for Regional and Minority Languages,",705,510
and seek specification under Part III.,607,511
In government we will ensure these obligations are fulfilled.,607,512
"The SNP is committed to a National Anti-Poverty Strategy,",504,514
"the aim of which is the eradication of structural poverty,",504,515
"both social and economic,",504,516
"as an integral element in the development of an economically dynamic and socially just Scotland with work,",504,517
education,506,518
and good health for all.,504,519
"The SNP would also promote ""poverty proofing"" -a process whereby agencies at all levels assess policies and programmes in relation to the likely impact they will have on poverty with a view to poverty reduction ",504,520
with specific and quantifiable targets the outcomes will be meaningful and achievable.,504,521
We would transfer the bureaucracy budget of Social Inclusion Partnerships to front line services particularly voluntary organisations dealing with poverty.,606,522
"The SNP abhors the current treatment of asylum seekers,",201,523
"in particular the voucher system,",201,524
which causes unnecessary hardship for many asylum-seeking families.,705,525
We also condemn the rhetoric of too many London politicians towards asylum seekers.,201,526
We would seek fast and fair assessment.,503,527
"The SNP will argue for the UK government to take immediate responsibility for the housing debt accrued by Scottish local authorities as a result of decades of Westminster rule,",414,529
and as has been done for the privatised water industry in England and Wales .,414,530
"This would relieve the burden of debt servicing from councils,",414,531
to free up cash for investment in Scotlands housing.,504,532
Until Independence,301,533
our team of MPs will press for control over housing benefit to be devolved to the Scottish,301,534
Parliament so that we can use it as a lever to drive down rents,504,535
and increase family incomes.,603,536
We will use the Scottish Trust for Public Investment and the variety of other means available to government to lever in desperately needed investment into housing to do this.,504,537
We are against wholesale stock transfer of council housing stock.,411,538
We support smallscale community transfers,411,539
where the tenants and,706,540
local communities want it.,301,541
We would promote housing legislation to cover all tenures.,504,542
"The policy in the rented sector would be based on the principle of Tenants First, Tenure Second.",504,543
"We believe in level playing fields for housing providers and choice for rent and purchase, which is sustainable.",416,544
"We will end challenge funding schemes for voluntary organisations, which waste thousands of pounds in preparing unsuccessful bids.",606,546
We recognise that voluntary organisations require core funding and will consult on methods of funding distribution.,606,547
This will include three-year core funding arrangements.,606,548
We will review the existing Voluntary Compact and alleviate concerns that a two-tier voluntary sector has been created.,606,549
"We will review the taxation regime for voluntary organisations,",606,550
and will exempt voluntary organisations from water charges.,606,551
Homelessness has reached record levels under New Labour.,705,553
"We will work to ensure effective delivery of services to end rough sleeping,",705,554
tackling the many issues which affect people forced to sleep rough.,705,555
We will also tackle hidden homelessness by providing homes and the support needed.,504,556
"The SNP has a long held commitment to a constitutionally enshrined guarantee of equal opportunities for all Scots regardless of race,",503,558
"gender,",503,559
"age,",503,560
"Sexuality,",503,561
disability,503,562
or social background.,503,563
We will continue to place this commitment at the centre of our actions both in the House of Commons and in the Scottish Parliament.,503,564
"Until Independence,",301,565
"we will press for legislative powers in this area to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament,",301,566
as it has been to the Northern Ireland Assembly.,301,567
Disabled people still face barriers of discrimination in many areas of life.,503,569
"Everyone should be given equality of opportunity to fulfil their potential,",503,570
"no matter who they are,",503,571
or how able they are.,503,572
No disabled person should be socially excluded,503,573
or find themselves in poverty because of their disability.,503,574
"Government has a responsibility to lead the way in ending discrimination against disabled people,",503,575
challenging attitudes,503,576
and ensuring that every area of legislation promotes equality of opportunity for disabled people within our society.,503,577
"As a first step, we will extend the powers and scope of the Disability Discrimination Act",503,578
and introduce a disability equality indicator.,503,579
Government must do more to identify dealers and bring them to justice;,605,581
more to provide focused and relevant education about the dangers of drugs;,603,582
and more to assist drug misusers with rehabilitation and support.,706,583
We recognise the need to support families of those misusing drugs,603,584
and to develop routes out of drug taking for communities affected by the growth in drug abuse.,706,585
"Our additional resources for Scotlands police forces,",605,586
"and the fast-tracking and treatment of drug misusers through Drugs Courts, will allow us to focus more on key elements of the drugs problem in our country.",605,587
The SNP will increase police resources to tackle crime,605,589
as well as recognising the rights and responsibilities of citizens in tackling crime.,605,590
The police are our front line against crime.,605,592
"Public perception is of declining police numbers,",605,593
a lessening of visible presence on the streets,605,594
and less security in our homes and communities.,605,595
"It is in recognition of the vital role played by our police that the SNP intends to make available a sum of £25 million specifically to provide 1,000 new officers in Scotland,",605,596
over and above the existing provision.,605,597
Every part of Scotland would benefit,605,598
and there would also be a welcome change in public perception and,605,599
an increase in public confidence that our streets were truly becoming safer.,605,600
It is the right of every individual in society to live safely and securely;,605,602
to have their privacy respected;,201,603
and to expect that their property and homes will be secure against criminal activity.,605,604
"However, the right of each individual is balanced by an equivalent responsibility not to behave in ways that deprive others of their rights.",201,605
We will introduce measures to tackle youth offending because those who begin to are young are likely to continue offending in later life.,605,606
The SNP believes that it is not just the responsibility of the education system to teach good citizenship -,506,607
first and foremost it is a job for parents who have primary responsibility for their children.,603,608
The SNP will consider a further extension of the existing legal responsibility of parents for the actions of their children.,603,609
"While it would not be appropriate to charge parents and take them through the criminal courts for actions committed by their offspring, it is nevertheless our view that it should be possible to institute a form of Compensation Order on parents",603,610
when the activities of their child have resulted in physical damage to property or tangible upset to a victim.,605,611
Any provision for such Orders would have to allow both for judicial discretion in imposing them,605,612
and the ability to take the financial circumstances of the parent/s into account.,603,613
"Nevertheless, the impact on the victim, who is otherwise left with the financial responsibility for a repair that is no fault of theirs, cannot be ignored.",706,614
The SNP believes that our criminal justice system should provide for a form of life-time supervision for those offenders for whom it was considered there would never be a point when they were regarded as no longer being a danger.,605,616
The SNP would move to implement the Maclean Report on Serious Violent & Sexual Offenders - in particular the recommendation for an Order for Lifelong Restriction for high-risk sex offenders.,605,617
This would ensure constant monitoring,605,618
and a recall to custody if the Order were breached.,605,619
We would provide for Supervised Release Orders to be available to the Courts even in Summary Cases.,605,620
"The SNP would ensure that the position is changed to provide that where a victim is over the age of 18, the offender would still be liable to have their name entered onto the Register.",605,621
There are other key areas where the SNP will take action.,605,623
We will set up a Sentencing Advisory Panel;,605,624
speed up the process of criminal cases in the lower courts which would be of benefit to both the accused and to victims;,605,625
and tackle once and for all the status of those who are deported to Scotland from other countries after having served sentences for very serious offences.,605,626
"The SNP at Westminster will also argue very strongly that as long as the current devolved arrangements prevail, Scotland should continue to get increases in money earmarked for justice initiatives",605,627
equivalent to those available in England and Wales.,503,628
"As part of this process we will continue to argue that the proportion of Fixed Penalty money and fine money, which at present is deposited with HM Treasury, is retained for use in Scotland",605,629
and reinvested in our criminal justice system.,605,630
No one in Scotland today knows how much they pay to the Government in taxation.,303,632
Under Labour the tax system has become increasingly complex.,303,633
The imposition of more and more stealth taxes has broken the democratic link between the government that sets and spends taxes and the people that pay them.,202,634
Complex taxation is inefficient,303,635
as well as undemocratic.,202,636
Labour have more than doubled the number of tax rates since they took power.,414,637
"On top of that there are more than 250 complex tax allowances, credits and disregards.",303,638
The overall cost of administering the UKs tax system is estimated by the Inland Revenue at 1.1 p for every £1 collected in tax.,303,639
In Ireland the cost is 0. 88p.,303,640
Reducing the cost of collection to the Irish level would save £90 million next year alone,414,641
- money that could be invested in public services.,504,642
Labour like the Tories have increased the share of tax that is levied indirectly and,414,643
takes no account of peoplé s ability to pay.,701,644
We want to tackle all of these problems with practical solutions.,303,645
It is not acceptable for political parties to mislead the people about taxation in elections.,202,646
We pledge to bring honesty and clarity to the debate with a series of proposals on taxation based on the following principles:,303,647
1 We will not introduce any new measures to increase the overall burden of taxation,414,648
or increase the rate of income tax without consulting the people first through our manifesto.,202,649
"2 We will undertake a Comprehensive Review of Taxation (CRT) to deliver fairness, simplicity, transparency and honesty in the taxation system.",303,650
The CRT will have a remit to produce reform proposals that taken together do not increase the overall burden of taxation.,414,651
One of our key aims in this review will be to cut business taxation.,402,652
Moreover we will not implement the full proposals of the CRT without putting them to the people in our next manifesto.,202,653
All our taxation policies will be informed by these core principles and for this election we offer the following specific proposals.,303,654
In advance of the CRT we propose one initial measure to fulfil our commitments to drive fuel prices down,414,655
and to shift the burden of taxation from unfair stealth taxation to honest fair taxation.,503,656
We believe that both these commitments require honest policy decisions now so in advance of the CRT we will cut taxation on fuel by 10p a gallon (including VAT).,414,657
This cut in taxation will cost £65m,414,658
"and will be paid for by introducing an extra 5p band of income taxation for those with taxable earnings over £ 100,000 per year (affecting only ten thousand of the wealthiest Scots) .",503,659
The Treasury estimates that this will raise £80 million paying easily for the fuel tax cut .,414,660
Any surplus in in revenues from this measure will be directed towards further reductions in duty as part of the process of achieving our target of bringing fuel prices into line with our competitors in Europe.,414,661
Taken together therefore these two measures are redistributive and will be revenue neutral.,503,662
The SNP will stand up for local government,301,664
and for proper long term funding of council services.,301,665
"In particular, we support a comprehensive review of local government finance",301,666
including investigation of a local income tax to replace the current council tax.,301,667
We recognise the need to adequately reward staff,704,668
and will work with local authorities,301,669
and trades unions,701,670
to improve conditions for public sector workers.,704,671
We stand for the right of local government to subsidiarity and,301,672
the continued direct delivery of public services.,504,673
We support proportional representation,202,674
and the introduction of single transferable voting to elect councillors.,202,675
"The foot-and-mouth disease brought into sharp focus the great difficulties which businesses face in rural Scotland,",703,677
and how vulnerable they are.,703,678
"Even before the outbreak began, rural Scotland faced economic problems.",703,679
"Rural Scotland now faces economic problems on an unprecedented scale,",703,680
as a result of a series of disastrous policies pursued by successive London governments.,703,681
"The SNP supports the following policy measures, with the aim of providing a level playing field for the rural economy.",703,682
Small businesses are the bedrock of the rural economy.,402,683
We will address each of the barriers to growth and,410,684
success of small business.,402,685
"We will use our tax review to consider proposals for a small business rates relief scheme,",402,686
which will seek to end the unfair burden which business rates pose for our small business.,403,687
The rural economy could be boosted by the promotion of information,402,688
and communication technology based businesses and teleworking.,411,689
This potential has not yet been realised.,411,690
"We support an immediate cut in excise duty on fuel of 10 pence per gallon,",402,691
and in the longer term will aim to reduce the burden of fuel tax to European average levels.,402,692
The burden of fuel costs is particularly high for rural communities,402,693
and we will use government power and influence to end the outrage of substantially higher prices in the Highlands and Islands.,402,694
We will seek to direct more resources and effort in improving rural public transport,703,695
and the rural transport infrastructure.,703,696
Governments role should be to reduce the unnecessary barriers and burdens facing rural producers.,703,697
"We will work to free up available euro cash, like agrimonetary compensation and support for scallop farmers.",703,698
"The SNP is determined to ensure that key services such as rural sub post offices,",703,699
rural schools,703,700
and rural transport links remain at the heart of rural Scotland.,703,701
An SNP government will ensure contingency funds are used to compensate business affected by the current crisis,402,702
and are available for use in the event of future crises in the rural economy.,703,703
The foot-and-mouth crisis across the UK has served to confirm the fragility of agriculture and its related industries and,703,705
also the sectors importance to Scotland.,703,706
There will need to be a comprehensive review of agricultural strategy once the current foot and mouth disease has been controlled.,703,707
That review will need to look very carefully at many issues of concern.,703,708
"These include procedures of entry into our ports,",703,709
"laxity of import controls on meat,",703,710
"mandatory country of origin labelling,",703,711
use of food remains and,703,712
the role of locally based abattoirs and processing plants.,703,713
"Until we get Independence,",301,714
"the SNP is determined to see Scottish ministers have a more direct involvement in European decision making,",108,715
and will continue to press for a direct and distinct voice for Scottish ministers at European Council meetings.,301,716
The SNP is determined to ensure a level playing field for our farmers in Europe.,703,717
Where the UK government has allowed competitive disadvantage for key sectors by the early and fullest implementation of European rules,110,718
", the SNP in government will only seek to introduce into domestic law European regulations when they have been adopted and applied in full by a majority of European nations.",203,719
"This will ensure that our farmers are not forced to operate under more restrictive and more expensive rules than farmers elsewhere within the EU,",703,720
and will therefore be more able to compete fairly in European markets.,703,721
"With the SNP in government, agriculture policy will be developed in the interests of Scotlands farming community",703,722
"and in response to specific Scottish circumstances,",703,723
rather than as a follow on to events elsewhere in the UK.,301,724
"This strategy will extend into the rural economy,",703,725
"with resources focused on diversification of efforts,",703,726
promotion of specialised agriculture -,703,727
such as free-range herds,703,728
"and organic produce,",703,729
where Scotland already has a natural advantage,703,730
 and with specific efforts to promote the export of quality Scottish produce.,703,731
The SNP believes the Less Favoured Areas deal will cause financial hardship for many farmers and,703,732
crofters and must be ameliorated.,703,733
"This should be done by the Scottish Executive using funds from other sources, such as modulation,",703,734
and by a comprehensive renegotiation of the original deal.,703,735
Recent events have demonstrated clearly why the voice of the fishing communities must be heard.,703,737
The SNP favours compensated tie-up schemes as an essential component of government aid packages.,703,738
"This would allow the fishing fleet to remain viable,",703,739
"protect juvenile stocks,",501,740
and protect the long-term future of the Scottish white fish fleet.,703,741
"Working with the industry, we will promote the introduction of technical conservation measures",703,742
that will ensure our coastal communities are able to benefit from sustainable fisheries.,416,743
At Westminster we will continue to seek designation of Scottish fisheries ministers as the UK lead in Europe,703,744
and will demand the return of the 6000 square miles of fishing grounds removed from Scottish jurisdiction by the government in London.,301,745
"While ensuring the Common Fisheries Policy guarantees Scotlands historic fishing rights, the SNP will seek its reform to include as a main principle the decentralisation of fisheries management through the establishment of Zonal Fisheries Management Councils.",301,746
"We will support the fish processing industry to ensure its continued competitiveness,",703,747
and assist Scotlands aquaculture sector to become a world leader.,703,748
"In addition, we will pursue a level playing field for the industry,",703,749
to ensure that our fishermen and fish processors do not face additional cost,703,750
and regulatory burdens as compared to our closest competitors.,703,751
"We will instruct a wide ranging and independent inquiry into fish farming in Scotland,",703,753
"following which we would seek to frame a long term strategy for the future of salmon farming,",703,754
"with particular regard to the need for Scotland to be competitive in relation to Ireland,",703,755
"Norway and other salmon farming countries,",703,756
and the securing of effective regulation of the industry,501,757
and the safeguarding of the environment.,703,758
"We would ensure that SEPA has the resources to carry out their tasks, by ending the payment of rent to the Crown Estate Commission.",703,759
The SNP has long been at the forefront of the campaign to modernise Scotlands land laws,301,761
"and to give communities increased say, control and involvement in the land.",301,762
We will continue to press for control of the Scottish Land Fund to be transferred from the London based trustees of the New Opportunities Fund to the Scottish Parliament.,301,763
"We support community right to buy,",301,764
but believe that more effective mechanisms must also be put in place to ensure greater involvement for communities who want to participate in decision-making in relation to their land,301,765
but want to stop short of ownership.,301,766
We will work with anglers and local communities,301,768
"to create a national freshwater fisheries policy that will ensure access,",703,769
maximise economic benefit for our rural economy,703,770
and ensure the protection of the environment.,501,771
We stand for restoring the link between the basic state pension and average earnings.,504,773
"We will press for the link to be restored at a UK level,",504,774
"and with Independence,",301,775
will restore the link for Scotlands pensioners each year for the term of the next Parliament.,504,776
This would mean that by the end of the next parliament pensioners could gain up to £200 a year in addition to Labours plans.,504,777
We will pay for this by utilising the surplus in the National Insurance Fund that has been created by the existing generation of pensioners.,504,778
"An SNP government will examine proposals that will ensure pensioners who have small occupational pensions,",504,779
or who are near the current threshold of income for taxation are not penalised by the tax treatment of these increases in the basic state pension.,504,780
As part of this we will examine proposals to allow a Scottish government to remove the distortions and inequities caused by the differentials between the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and the basic state pension,503,781
-a means testing that discriminates against too many on low incomes who have saved for their old age.,504,782
It is our aim to work to equalise the basic state pension and,503,783
the level of the MIG as resources become available.,504,784
The SNP continues to support the payment of a cold climate allowance - paid to pensioners throughout the winter months.,504,785
"As a first step to achieving this aim, we will on a weekly basis spread payments of the current winter fuel assistance over the winter months.",504,786
An SNP government will examine the level of bureaucracy within the social security system.,303,788
This will take three forms.,303,789
Firstly we will examine the structure for social security delivery.,303,790
"Where as the UK has the bureaucracy and waste of three separate social security agencies, / the SNP will investigate the creation of a single agency responsible for the streamlining of benefit payments at all levels in Scotland.",504,791
Secondly we will examine the actual delivery of key benefits to minimise bureaucracy and cost.,303,792
"For example, we will undertake a review of housing benefit.",303,793
It is our belief that the rules can be simplified,303,794
and the process of payment accelerated.,303,795
Our overall aim however is to re-direct housing benefit to drive down housing costs,504,796
and improve family incomes.,603,797
The core purpose of our review will be to simplify and increase the effectiveness of the system.,303,798
"Finally, we will examine the workings and effectiveness of each benefit,",303,799
with the aim of removing unnecessary barriers to uptake,504,800
and to increasing support to key groups.,504,801
We will streamline the application process,303,803
and review the tests and timescales to ensure those who are entitled to support get it quickly.,504,804
We will also consider proposals to review Welfare to Work beneficiary rules so that disabled people moving into work are not penalised financially.,705,805
We will also reform financial support for carers so the system reflects the value of and savings to the state that their caring provides to society.,504,806
It is our aim to extend the winter fuel allowance to severely disabled people under 60 as resources become available.,504,808
We will review overall financial support available to 16 and 17 year olds including targeted restoration of benefits as resources become available.,504,810
In general we support initiatives to help families from welfare to work.,603,812
"We will however examine the delivery of the Working Families Tax Credit,",603,813
which can lead to prohibitive levels of marginal taxation sometimes up to 96% as people lose out on other benefits e.g. housing benefit.,603,814
"Because it is a benefit that has to be applied for, we would also examine concerns over the take up rate for Working Families Tax Credit,",603,815
discrepancies in how some employers can abuse the system,605,816
and examine options to ensure that more families access the money available.,603,817
We support the provision of information and advice as an essential part of benefit take up campaigns.,504,819
"At Westminster, our MPs will press to ensure that Scotland gets her fair share of the UK governments transport investment - investment that currently will not be distributed on a population basis.",503,821
"In government, we will use the STPI to bring in lower cost private investment.",402,822
"An efficient and effective transport network is the key to Scotlands success, socially and economically.",411,823
We recognise that it is the job of government to provide the delivery framework,411,824
and the focus to help people and goods get to where they want to go.,411,825
An SNP government would set out the overall strategy and frameworks.,411,826
Regional Transport Authorities (RTAs) will be publicly accountable,202,827
and will be responsible for the delivery of regional transport solutions.,303,828
We will introduce a single safety authority for all forms of transport.,411,829
Air safety is paramount and Air Traffic Control will remain under public sector control.,412,830
Initially we would take shares for subsidy to create a public sharé of Railtrack to guarantee a level of public accountability,202,831
without ruling out the possibility of public ownership.,413,832
We would reconnect communities,411,833
and re-open key strategic lines including direct rail links with airports.,411,834
We would develop a strategy to systematically deal with the electrification of key rail lines.,411,835
Electrification of the East Coast main line,411,837
Edinburgh airport link,411,838
Reopening of the Borders rail line,411,839
Stirling - Alloa - Rosyth ferry port,411,840
Glasgow Cross City Rail and airport link project,411,841
Inverness - Aberdeen (Orton loop).,411,842
"We would work with providers to achieve a national concessionary travel scheme for children and young adults under 18,",504,843
"students,",504,844
Pensioners,504,845
and people with disabilities,504,846
and their carers.,504,847
We will consult on the introduction of light rail systems for Scotlands cities to help relieve traffic congestion.,501,848
We will initiate a national care and repair programme of existing roads.,411,849
We will initiate a limited programme of road building to tackle bottlenecks and,411,850
to fill gaps of roads unfinished by previous Labour and Tory administrations.,411,851
Our early priorities for investment through the STPI and a range of other delivery mechanisms are:,411,852
M74 extension,411,853
Aberdeen City by-pass,411,854
A8000 link (M9/M8),411,855
A75,411,856
M8 link (Newhouse - Ballieston),411,857
Upgrading of the A9,411,858
The SNP is committed to bringing forward proposals for the reduction in ferry fares in Scotland as part of a process towards the piloting and evaluation of Road Equivalent Tariffs.,411,859
Academic research has suggested that lower ferry fares could be introduced on a cost neutral basis.,411,860
Equal treatment for island communities will be at the core of decision making in an SNP government.,503,861
"We would promote freight and passenger hub airports in Scotland,",411,862
and conduct a Scottish airports review aimed at increasing direct flights from Scotland to Europe and,411,863
"placing downward pressure on fare prices and landing charges,",411,864
with a particular focus on the large supplement fares paid by Scottish consumers for holiday charter flights.,411,865
In line with our long standing commitment we will abolish tolls on the Skye Bridge as an early priority,411,866
and will explore the opportunities of bringing the bridge into trust for the nation under the STPI.,301,867
Everyone agrees Westminster needs to change.,602,6
"The SNP is ready to play a constructive role, to challenge the old order with new and progressive ideas.",301,7
Its time to put fairness and equality back at the heart of government.,503,8
With a strong SNP team at Westminster we can use our influence to end the needless pain of Tory cuts.,301,9
"And we can campaign to secure more money for health,",504,10
education,506,11
and childcare.,504,12
Here are our key priorities to make Scotland stronger at Westminster:,301,13
SNP  MPs  will  demand  an  end  to  austerity.,409,15
We  oppose  further spending  cuts  and  propose  modest  spending  increases   of  0.5  per  cent  above  inflation   in  each  year  of  the  next  Parliament.,409,16
"Under our plan, the deficit will still reduce each year,",414,17
"but there will be at least an additional £140 billion across the UK to invest in skills and infrastructure,",411,18
"in our NHS and other public services,",504,19
and in measures to protect the vulnerable and lift people out of poverty.,503,20
"We will also vote for the following revenue raising measures the reintroduction of the 50 pence top tax rate,",409,21
"a tax on bankers' bonuses,",409,22
"a bank levy,",409,23
"a mansion tax,",409,24
"a crackdown on tax avoidance,",605,25
the abolition of 'nondom' status,409,26
and reversal of the married couples tax allowance.,503,27
We will meet the NHS funding challenge laid down in the report of the NHS Chief Executive in England  the Stevens Report and vote for an increase in NHS spending across the UK of £24 billion by 202021 £9.5 billion above inflation.,504,29
This will deliver a total boost to the NHS Scotland budget of £2 billion by 202021.,504,30
SNP MPs will also vote against any further privatisation of the NHS in England and back any moves to restore it to a fully public service.,413,31
We will support a singletier pension of £160 per week,504,33
"and vote to continue the triple lock, guaranteeing that pensions will always rise by inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent whichever is the highest.",504,34
We will also vote to protect the Winter Fuel Allowance.,504,35
We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit  introduced to reward people for saving for their pension,504,36
and we will seek a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.,504,37
We will oppose plans for a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons,105,39
and seek to build an alliance in the House of Commons against Trident renewal.,105,40
"We will vote for the £100 billion that the Westminster parties plan to spend on Trident renewal to be invested instead in better childcare, education and the NHS.",105,41
We will vote to increase the minimum wage to £8.70 by 2020.,412,43
We will also support measures to extend the Living Wage across the UK.,412,44
"The Scottish Government already pays the Living Wage to all of its own employees and to those covered by its pay policy we will call on,",412,45
"and vote for, the UK government to adopt the same policy.",412,46
It is estimated that an additional one million children across the UK will be living in poverty by 2020.,504,48
"That is unacceptable and would mean an additional 100,000 children in Scotland growing up in poverty.",504,49
That is why we will vigorously oppose plans for further cuts in Child Benefit and Tax Credits allowing these payments to erode in value simply pushes more children into poverty.,504,50
"Instead, we will vote to increase benefits at least in line with CPI inflation//,",504,51
to ensure that the incomes of the poorest in society do not fall even further behind the cost of living.,503,52
And we will support an increase in free childcare to 30 hours per week by 2020.,504,53
We will vote to block plans to cut Disability Living Allowance by £3 billion across the UK by 201718.,504,55
Scotlands share of that cut is around £310 million per year.,504,56
"These cuts would see more than 100,000 disabled people in Scotland  and one million across the UK  losing over £1,100 a year in the support that they rely on to live independent lives.",503,57
We will use our influence to make sure that these cuts do not proceed,504,58
and that disabled people are given the support they deserve.,503,59
We will also support an increase in Carers Allowance so that it matches Jobseekers' Allowance.,504,60
Those in receipt of Carers Allowance will benefit by almost £600 per year.,504,61
We will vote for the immediate abolition of the unfair Bedroom Tax.,503,63
Abolishing the Bedroom Tax would mean that the £35 million a year that the Scottish Government is spending to compensate those affected by it would be available to spend on other priorities.,503,64
We would invest that money in measures to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.,503,65
We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland,506,67
and support the reduction of tuition fees across the UK.,506,68
"We will extend the availability of Educational Maintenance Allowance in Scotland to an additional 10,000 school pupils",506,69
"and 12,000 part time college students.",506,70
"At least 330,000 Scottish jobs  around one in seven of all jobs are dependent on our membership of the single market.",108,72
That is why we will oppose a referendum on membership of the EU.,108,73
Being part of Europe is good for business,108,74
and it supports jobs in Scotland and across the UK.,108,75
"If an in/out EU referendum does go ahead, we will seek to amend the legislation to ensure that no constituent part of the UK can be taken out of the EU against its will.",108,76
"We will propose a 'double majority' rule meaning that unless England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each vote to leave the EU, the UK would remain a member state.",108,77
Diversity is one of Scotland's great strengths.,607,79
"Effective immigration controls are important,",403,80
but we must also remember that those who have come to Scotland from other countries make a significant contribution to our economy and our society.,607,81
We will support sensible immigration policies that meet our economic needs,403,82
"and, as a priority, we will seek the reintroduction of the post study work visa, so that those we have helped educate are able, if they so choose, to make a contribution to our economy.",403,83
There is a substantial shortfall of affordable houses for rent across the UK.,503,85
"The Scottish Government is on track to meet the commitment to 30,000 new affordable homes by 2016, but more needs to be done.",503,86
"We will back investment in an annual house building target across the UK of 100,000 affordable homes a year.",503,87
We will also continue our support for Help to Buy and shared equity to help people get a foot on the housing ladder.,503,88
We will support targeted reductions to employers National Insurance contributions to support job creation and the extension of the Living Wage.,402,90
"We will support an increase in the Employment Allowance from £2,000 per business per year to £6,000 per business per year, reducing the cost of creating and maintaining jobs.",402,91
We will support this change being phased in over the fouryear period to 201920.,402,92
In work poverty is a modern day scandal that must be tackled.,503,94
We support increases in the personal tax allowance,503,95
but will also back an increase in the Work Allowance  the amount people are allowed to earn before their benefit is cut  of 20 per cent.,701,96
This will encourage people back into work by reducing the amount the state claws back  making work pay more.,701,97
We will also support tough action to end exploitative zero hours contracts.,701,98
We will support lower energy bills for consumers by pushing for the Energy Company Obligation to be funded through general taxation and not as a levy on energy bills.,403,100
We will also support new powers to make sure that energy companies pass on the benefits of lower prices to consumers.,403,101
We will also press for a change to the transmission charging system that is penalising Scottish generators,402,102
and threatening the future of Longannet power station.,402,103
"We will call on, and vote for, the UK Government to adopt Scotlands ambitious carbon reduction targets.",501,105
We will also continue to support a moratorium on fracking.,416,106
We believe that women should be properly represented in public life.,503,108
"We will push for 50:50 representation on public and private boards, //`",503,109
and ensure that women are fairly treated at work with action to secure equal pay,503,110
and greater support for working parents with increased paternity leave.,503,111
Westminster badly needs to be reformed.,202,113
An unelected second chamber is not acceptable in a modern democracy.,202,114
Those with no democratic mandate should not be writing the laws of the land,202,115
and SNP MPs will vote for the abolition of the House of Lords.,202,116
We will also vote for the replacement of the first past the post voting system with proportional representation.,202,117
The SNP will always support independence but that is not what this election is about.,602,119
It is about making Scotland stronger.,602,120
We will use the influence of SNP votes at Westminster to ensure that promises made during the referendum are delivered.,602,121
"We will demand, firstly, that the proposals of the Smith Commission are delivered quickly and in full.",602,122
We believe that these proposals do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.,602,123
We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.,301,124
"As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals has demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would underpin it would take a number of years.",301,125
SNP MPs will work to secure the best deal for Scotland.,301,126
"In the meantime, we will prioritise devolution of powers over employment policy, including the minimum wage,",412,127
"welfare,",504,128
"business taxes,",402,129
national insurance,402,130
and equality policy,503,131
"the powers we need to create jobs,",701,132
grow revenues,410,133
and lift people out of poverty.,503,134
"If there is an antiTory majority in the House of Commons, we will vote in a motion of confidence against a Tory government getting off the ground.",305,136
The SNP is the third largest party in the UK following a surge in new members since the referendum.,305,137
"80,000 have joined since September 2014, with total membership now over 105,000.",305,138
The SNPs 59 candidates includes prominent Yes campaigners and others who have only just joined the party.,305,139
Here are some of their stories:,305,140
PRIORITIES FOR A FAIRER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL SCOTLAND,503,142
"Whether in Scotland or at Westminster, our focus will be on growing Scotlands economy",410,143
and making life better for people across our country.,503,144
"This is what underpins our policies on public finances, on education, health, housing and social justice",503,145
and our support for the Scottish Parliament having more of the powers it needs.,301,146
"We want more people in rewarding, well paid work.",701,147
"We want stronger local economies,",301,148
with job opportunities for our young people close to home,701,149
So we can retain the important links of family and community that add to the strength and wellbeing of our society.,606,150
But this is not economic growth for its own sake.,416,151
It must be sustainable and with the benefits shared across society.,416,152
"It will be wealth creation so we can, once and for all, address the unacceptable levels of inequality in Scottish society.",416,153
"As we set out in this manifesto, we will be able to build Scotlands success and deliver on our ambitions by harnessing the energy of our people, by building our skills and using them to the full, and by making the most of our nations great natural wealth and many competitive and comparative advantages.",601,154
"The more SNP MPs that are elected to Westminster, the louder Scotland's voice will be in the decisions that are taken there",602,155
and that means we can secure the best deal for Scotland and a more progressive approach for the benefit of people across the UK.,301,156
"SNP MPs, backed by hundreds of thousands of new supporters many voting SNP at Westminster for the very first time can make a real difference to the direction our country takes in the years ahead.",301,157
With greater influence for Scotland at Westminster,301,158
"and new powers for our parliament in Edinburgh,",301,159
there is so much more we can achieve for the people of Scotland.,602,160
SNP MPs will: Make sure Westminster works better for the people of Scotland,602,161
The biggest threat to Scotlands public services and our social fabric is the ongoing Tory and Labour obsession with austerity cuts to vital public spending.,504,162
That is why we propose responsible increases in public spending.,504,163
We will support increases in infrastructure investment,411,164
as part of our plans to generate new jobs,701,165
"and support higher levels of growth,",410,166
and we will work to open access to finances for businesses looking to expand.,402,167
Our approach is to secure a fair deal for all,503,168
"with those on the very highest incomes contributing a little bit more to ensure that we can continue to deliver universal, free public services",503,169
and protect the most vulnerable from the impacts of poverty.,503,170
"We back the planned expansion of childcare with 30hours a week of free nursery education for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds,",504,172
providing the best possible start in life for younger Scots and making life easier for their parents.,504,173
"We support a big increase in NHS spending in Scotland, and across the UK, to enable the Scottish government to continue improving our health service.",504,174
Our plans will mean £2 billion more for our NHS by 202021.,504,175
We will also use our votes at Westminster to protect the health service in all parts of the UK from privatisation.,413,176
"We agree that we need to maximise opportunities for our young people and support an increase to 30,000 Modern Apprenticeships",411,177
"and the expansion of the Education Maintenance Allowance to an extra 22,000 school pupils and students.",506,178
We will: Propose different choices on spending so we can protect fundamental public services and ensure irreparable damage isnt done to the fabric of society.,409,180
This will allow modest increases in public spending in each year of the next parliament,409,181
 it will also see deficit fall every year as a share of income.,414,182
"Argue for a fairer approach on taxation, with those with the very most contributing a little bit more",503,183
"Focus on investment to support economic growth and the creation of a more productive, highskill, highwage economy",410,184
"Seek to enshrine in law key principles of future financial management, including elimination of the deficit and balanced current account spending",414,185
"by stimulating growth in the economy,",410,186
as part of a medium term strategy to ensure prudent levels of debt are achieved,414,187
"Support the creation of a sovereign wealth fund so that we create a financial buffer for the future, protecting public finances in times of crisis",414,188
We are working hard to make life better for people across Scottish society and the plans we set out in this manifesto will see some new and important gains.,503,190
"For our NHS  well support a funding package for the NHS, that would see spending in Scotland rise by a total of £2 billion by 202021,",504,191
helping us to deliver the worldclass care that people in Scotland rightly expect.,504,192
"For fair pay  well back an increase in the minimum wage to £8.70 by 2020,",412,193
"making a quarter of a million people in Scotland better off by up to £4,000 a year.",503,194
For hardpressed households  we will support lower energy bills for consumers by pushing for the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) to be funded through general taxation,503,195
"and tough new powers to make sure energy companies pass on lower energy prices to consumers, saving households around £100 on energy bills based on recent wholesale prices.",403,196
"For more jobs and growing businesses  we will seek seedfund capitalisation of the Scottish Business Development Bank, enabling new investment in Scottish business growth and innovation,",402,197
helping create thousands of new jobs,701,198
"For people approaching retirement  well seek a review of the planned increase in the retirement age from 66 to 67, so that people in Scotland, who have paid in to a state pension all their lives, dont lose out.",504,199
"For people moving into work  well vote for an increase in the work allowance by 20 per cent, which means people moving in to work from benefits will keep more of their income.",701,200
"For unpaid carers  we propose an increase in carers allowance to bring it in line with jobseekers allowance, which will see over 100,000 unpaid carers in Scotland better off by almost £600 a year.",504,201
"For pensioners  we want a singletier pension set at £160 per week, with the triplelock protection continuing.",504,202
This will guarantee that the value of the state pension is fully protected.,504,203
"For no new nuclear weapons  we continue to oppose nuclear weapons and will seek to block a new generation of nuclear weapons,",105,204
saving as much as £4 billion a year in the mid2020s.,105,205
For a greener Scotland  we will continue to support a moratorium on fracking.,501,206
For our veterans  we believe that those who have been injured in the service of our country should get the full value of any war disablement pension and we will work to ensure that it is not treated as income in the assessment of entitlement to other benefits.,104,207
"For our cities  we believe that City Deals should be made available to all Scotlands cities, in addition to Glasgow, bringing substantial new investment to places that are key drivers of growth in Scotland.",410,208
"For our farming community  we will look to secure a fair share of the UKs CAP convergence uplift, which comes to the UK as a result of Scotlands low hectare rates.",703,209
For workers in the oil & gas sector  well keep the pressure on the UK Treasury to do all it can to protect jobs,701,210
and investment in the oil and gas industry in light of lower global oil prices,402,211
and will work to increase internationalisation opportunities for Scotlands oil and gas industry,402,212
For a fairer Scotland  well prioritise the immediate scrapping of the Bedroom Tax and a halt to the roll out of Universal Credit and PIP.,503,213
Well seek to reverse the replacement of Disability Living Allowance by PIP and oppose the £3 billion cut in disability funding.,504,214
"In addition, we will seek an urgent reform of the conditionality and sanctions regime, to establish a fairer approach.",503,215
"For Scotlands creative sector  well seek increased investment through BBC Scotland so that a fairer share of the licence fee is spent in Scotland, giving a £100 million boost to our creative sector.",502,216
For local job creators  we will continue the Small Business Bonus,402,217
and back reduced Employers NI contributions to support job creation.,402,218
For greater equality we will demand early action on equal pay audits for big companies to increase the pressure to deliver equal pay for women across the UK.,503,219
We'll also support the abolition of VAT on sanitary products.,503,220
"For young Scots  well deliver 30,000 Modern Apprenticeships each year",411,221
and continue to keep university education free.,506,222
We will also back an increase in the minimum wage rate for 18 to 21 year olds to £6.86 by 2020 and believe the same rate should be paid to apprentices.,412,223
We will also support an increase in the rate for 16 to 18 year olds to £5.07.,412,224
"For our planet we will use our influence at Westminster to ensure the UK matches, and supports, Scotlands ambitious commitments to carbon reduction.",501,225
For future generations  we should have greater financial security in the years ahead and so will call for a share of future revenues from our natural energy resources to be saved in an energy fund.,501,226
"For lowincome households  well back an increase of at least the cost of living in welfare benefits, such as child benefit, universal credit and disability benefits, and also in tax credits.",503,227
For an end to Tory rule  if there are more antiTory MPs than Tory MPs in the House of Commons the only way the Conservatives get back in to government is if the Labour party let them.,305,228
The SNP will work with others to lock the Tories out of government.,305,229
"For safer communities  well continue to deliver 1,000 extra police officers, a policy that has helped deliver record low crime levels in our communities.",605,230
Well also press for the revenue from court fines to be retained in Scotland,301,231
"and for Police Scotland and our Fire and Rescue Service to receive the same VAT exemption as other forces, with the money reinvested in safer communities.",605,232
"For a new northern focus  well back budget plans to invest more in the infrastructure of Scotland and the north of England,",411,233
"including the commissioning of high speed rail linking Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England.",411,234
"For young families  we will work towards an expansion in free nursery education, from 16 hours a week to 30 hours, saving parents just under £2,000 per child per year by the end of the next Scottish Parliament",504,235
and giving thousands of young Scots a better start in life.,503,236
"For more homes  we will back plans for an annual UK target of 100,000 affordable homes and use additional capital investment to deliver a further expansion of housebuilding in Scotland, including affordable homes for purchase or rent.",503,237
For small businesses  we will press the UK government to introduce effective legal protections to ensure small businesses are paid on time.,403,238
"This election is an exciting opportunity for Scotland to deliver real change, here and across the UK.",602,240
"At this election with every SNP seat, comes more power for Scotland.",301,241
"More power to pursue a real alternative to unfair cuts, an end to the Bedroom Tax,",503,242
a higher minimum wage,412,243
and protection for our NHS and valued public services.,504,244
We will invest in our economy to create more and better paid jobs.,409,245
And we will oppose a new generation of nuclear weapons.,105,246
And we will stand up for Scotland's best interests.,301,247
We always do.,301,248
Thats why SNP MPs will vote against any measure at Westminster that affects Scotland's interests or has the effect of reducing Scotlands funding.,301,249
We believe in independence but that is not what this election is about.,602,250
A vote for the SNP is a vote to rebalance the economic and political priorities of the UK.,301,251
"It is a vote for new, better and more progressive politics for everyone.",301,252
It is a vote to make Scotland's voice heard.,602,253
Throughout this Parliament SNP MPs have worked hard to take forward the priorities of people in Scotland.,602,255
"Weve voted: against Tory plans, backed by Labour in January of this year, for an extra £30 billion of spending cuts.",409,256
A vote for the SNP in this election is the strongest possible vote against Westminsters austerity agenda,409,257
"to block the replacement of Trident, which would save as much as £100 billion over its lifetime,",105,258
money that we believe should be used for our health service,504,259
and to educate Scotlands children,506,260
against the abolition of the top rate of tax,503,261
against the privatisation of the Royal Mail,413,262
"and to protect people from drilling under their homes without their permission, by opposing the Infrastructure Bill, and backing a moratorium on fracking.",416,263
"With enough SNP MPs in the House of Commons, we can end the current austerity agenda and release new investment in jobs and growth, in strengthening our society and in protecting vital public services",409,266
SNP MPs will oppose austerity and never do a deal with the Tories.,409,267
"If there is an antiTory majority of MPs, we will vote to lock out the Tories from government.",305,268
And we will make sure any Labour government cant forget Scotland.,602,269
"Quite simply, Scotland can get better government and real influence by voting for the SNP in May.",301,270
The starting point for the next parliament and government must be an approach to the public finances that works.,414,272
"There can be no doubt, based on the Office for Budget Responsibilitys figures and the targets set by the current government itself, that George Osbornes approach has failed on multiple counts, with borrowing rising substantially.",414,273
"Indeed, net borrowing in this financial year has exceeded the June 2010 forecast by around £50 billion.",414,274
"This is due, in large part, to a crucial weakness in the economic recovery, in particular lower than anticipated tax revenues in an economy that has become low wage and low reward for too many.",414,275
"At the same time, taxes have been cut for those at the very top of the income scale.",414,276
It is clear that a different way of doing things is needed one that places greater emphasis on economic growth,410,277
"and social solidarity,",503,278
with a realistic target to reduce government debt to a prudent level,414,279
and to maintain a balanced budget on average over the medium term.,414,280
We need a proper fiscal framework based on proven principles that have been successfully implemented elsewhere.,414,281
This includes a commitment to reduce overall government debt and move to a position of operating budget surpluses over the medium term.,414,282
"In addition, we believe fiscally responsible governments should establish a financial buffer against unforeseen future events.",414,283
"We reject the current trajectory of spending, proposed by the UK government and the limited alternative proposed by the Labour Party.",409,284
Our proposal would see public sector borrowing and public sector net debt falling in every year as a share of national income.,414,285
"In total, over £140 billion of additional public expenditure and investment would be available during the next parliament, compared to current UK government plans.",409,286
"We will also look to release additional resources by backing a series of revenue raising measures the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate, a tax on bankers' bonuses, a bank levy,   a mansion tax, a crackdown on tax avoidance, the abolition of 'non dom' status, reversal of the married couples' tax allowance, and a review of the pension tax relief available to the wealthiest.",409,287
We need increased investment in economic growth,410,289
"and action to get more people into rewarding, sustainable, wellpaid employment.",701,290
"As set out above, we propose modest spending increases to invest in the economy, enabling us to deliver a stronger fiscal performance over the mediumterm.",409,291
"A stronger economy is the essential underpinning for deficit reduction in the UK, with higher levels of growth delivering increased revenues and reducing spending pressures.",409,292
"More broadly, improvements to productivity would translate into big medium and longterm improvements in the UKs fiscal position.",409,293
We believe that this should be a central focus for government policy over the next 5 years.,404,294
The key is to both protect and promote key sectors of the Scottish economy.,404,295
The UK government has agreed to implement the key proposals put forward by the Scottish Government and the oil and gas industry.,404,296
"This is a welcome step, however, we will continue to closely monitor economic activity in the North Sea and look for a prompt and effective response from the UK government so we can maximise the economic opportunity.",404,297
"Action by the UK government was a necessary first step and will sit alongside the Scottish Governments commitment to a new Oil and Gas Strategy, which will have a strong focus on Scotlands oil and gas supply chain,",404,298
including ongoing skills development and opportunities for greater internationalisation of the sector.,404,299
We will also continue to push for the swift deployment of the new Oil and Gas Authority in Aberdeen.,301,300
"There are a number of additional steps we believe should be taken by the UK government, while they continue to hold the reserved responsibility, to boost Scotlands economic performance.",404,301
This includes additional capital investment to support sustainable and broadbased economic recovery,404,302
and make the country as a whole more internationally competitive.,404,303
"Despite having limited powers, we have taken action to boost our economy and support employment.",402,305
"For example, at the height of the financial crisis, we were able to accelerate capital investment in shovel ready projects",402,306
"and could also take forward a range of innovative financing mechanisms and get better value for money through the Scottish Futures Trust,",402,307
"meaning more money was available for frontline, job creation projects.",402,308
"In addition, our specific focus on youth employment, with guarantees on access to education and training and a massive expansion of Modern Apprenticeship places,",411,309
and our support for small businesses with an extensive rates relief package (helping many survive the worst of the crisis),402,310
have made a difference for thousands of people across Scotland.,503,311
"Weve also made sure people have more money in their pockets, with the Council Tax frozen, real terms cuts in water bills and policies like free prescriptions providing a welcome boost for family incomes.",503,312
"Thanks to this approach, more money is available to spend in local economies.",409,313
"As a result, we have reduced unemployment, increased employment in Scotland and have a stronger record on youth employment than the UK.",701,314
"We firmly believe that additional investment in Scotlands infrastructure, and that of the rest of the UK, is an important part of building the wider strength of our economy and society.",411,316
Our proposals for additional expenditure in the next Parliament will include substantial new infrastructure investment.,411,317
"Properly deployed, capital expenditure has the ability to reduce inequalities by providing good, well paid employment, with opportunities for the longterm unemployed, for apprenticeships and for wider skills and professional development.",503,318
"It also serves to expand the productive capacity of Scotland, making our economy more competitive, with improved connectivity and infrastructure that is fit for the 21st century.",411,319
"The additional investment we seek should include investment in our energy infrastructure so we can continue to maximise renewables generation, in particular offshore.",411,320
"Current Westminster plans put at risk the creation of a strong domestic renewables industry, including a sustainable supply chain, and threaten Scotlands security of supply.",416,321
"We will, for example, press for further progress and a clear timescale for the delivery of the islands interconnector and reform of the transmission charging regime which could lead to the premature closure of Longannet power station.",411,322
We will also support steps to increase the capital available to the Green Investment Bank,416,323
and will ask the next UK government to report on options including new borrowing powers for the bank.,416,324
"We will also seek adequate transport infrastructure investment, with a particular aim of improving transport and communication links across the north of these isles.",411,325
"That includes connecting Scotland to HS2 as a priority, with construction beginning in Scotland as well as England,",411,326
"and a high speed connection between Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England as part of any highspeed rail network.",411,327
"In addition, we will seek additional investment to support a more rapid roll out of superfast broadband and 4G across Scotland",411,328
"and to support wider and affordable access to the internet in our most disadvantaged communities,",411,329
and for a Universal Service Obligation to be applied to telecoms and broadband providers ensuring everyone is able to access the communications they need.,411,330
"We will back investment a housebuilding target across the UK of 100,000 affordable homes per year.",503,331
"We are determined to use capital investment to create jobs,",701,332
and support higher levels of economic growth.,410,333
"This additional investment would support at least 6,500 jobs in the construction sector in Scotland.",701,334
"We want to make it much easier for growing businesses across Scotland to access finance and will look for an expansion of lending options, including peertopeer lending and making it easier for new entrants to the market, in particular to help with short term financing.",402,336
We believe the UK government should be doing more to rebalance economic activity on these isles,301,337
"and so we will press for seedfund capitalisation of the new Scottish Business Development Bank, enabling new finance and investment for Scottish business to maximise job creation and growth.",402,338
"We support calls for more readily available export finance and believe the steps outlined in the Scottish Governments updated Economic Strategy, with its focus on internationalisation, will boost export opportunities for Scottish businesses and help increase the number of Scottish exporters.",402,339
We also believe that more should be done to help small businesses with cash flow and will press the UK government to introduce effective legal protections to ensure small businesses are paid on time.,402,340
We agree that small businesses should have rights within key utility markets more akin to those of household consumers.,403,341
"For our tourism sector, we will press for the early devolution of Air Passenger Duty (APD) so we can use this new power to encourage more direct flights to Scotland,",402,342
with a reduction of 50 per cent and longer term plans to abolish APD completely.,402,343
"We will also support examining a reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector,",402,344
levelling the playing field with other EU nations,403,345
"and helping create as many as 10,000 new jobs.",701,346
"For our creative industries, we will press for the BBC in Scotland to receive a fairer share of licence fee revenue generated in Scotland, which would bring a £100 million boost to Scotlands creative sector.",502,347
We support the creation of a Creative Content Fund for the games industry to encourage the formation of new studios,502,348
and also back the retention of the Video Games tax relief.,502,349
We back industry calls for an increase in the SEIS investment limit and changes to the Shortage Occupation List to recognise specific skills needs in the sector.,502,350
Scotland needs an immigration policy suited to our specific circumstances and needs.,408,351
"In particular, we wish to see the reintroduction of the poststudy work visa so students who have been educated in Scotland can spend 2 years working here after their studies and can contribute to growing our economy.",410,352
"We will examine proposals to maintain the Annual Investment Allowance at a stable rate and consider whether it can be maintained at £500,000 and whether it can be extended until the end of the next Parliament in 2020.",402,353
"This allowance supports investment in plant, machinery and premises and we believe business deserves certainty to enable them to make longerterm investment decisions.",402,354
"We will also support a phased increase in the Employment Allowance from £2,000 per business per year to £6,000 per business per year by 201920.",402,355
This will provide a boost to employment growth by reducing the cost of creating and maintaining jobs.,402,356
This proposal will particularly benefit smaller businesses with over 95% of the support going to smaller firms.,402,357
The SNP will use its influence at Westminster to deliver key economic advantages for Scotland.,301,359
Our proposals include: An increase in the minimum wage to £8.70by 2020.,412,360
Easier access to finance for growing Scottish companies through the Scottish Business Development Bank,402,361
A boost for Scotlands tourism and hospitality sectors with plans for a reduction in Air Passenger Duty,402,362
More spending in local economies with an increased minimum wage and lower National Insurance costs for companies to help create jobs,402,363
A £100 million investment in jobs in the creative sector with BBC Scotland receiving a fairer share of the licence fee.,502,364
Increased investment in infrastructure as part of our alternative to the failed UK austerity agenda,411,365
"We believe that public sector organisations should be able to bid to operate rail services,",413,366
as allowed in EU law but currently prevented by UK legislation.,108,367
This would enable us to ensure the delivery of rail services in Scotland that deliver maximum economic and social benefit.,413,368
One of the greatest indictments of the current Westminster system is that it works best for one part of society and one part of the country.,602,370
"Social and geographic imbalances are increasing at a worrying rate, with an increasing imbalance between London, and the southeast, and the rest of the UK.",301,371
SNP MPs will seek to rebalance the UK for the benefit of people in the north and west of these isles.,301,372
"We believe that investment in so called national projects in London, should be subject to normal consequential funding for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland",301,373
"and that the North of England, in particular, should see a significant increase in infrastructure expenditure.",411,374
"Alongside the development of High Speed Rail from London to the Midlands,",411,375
"we will seek a commitment to deliver High Speed Rail between Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England as the first stage of a link connecting Scotland and the north of England to London.",411,376
High Speed Rail should be constructed both from the north down and from the south up.,411,377
"We will support Scotlands city authorities with proposals for new City Deals  like the one already agreed with Glasgow and Clyde Valley  and will seek the creation of a £300 million Scottish Cities Fund, and similar Northern Cities and Welsh Cities funds, to ensure adequate resources are available to support the growth of major urban centres in the north and west of the UK.",301,378
"While a strong London is good for the UK, also having a strong Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, Cardiff, Newcastle and Leeds is even better.",301,379
"The SNP will also aim to right a longterm economic injustice, by ensuring that a share of future oil and gas and renewable energy revenues are used to create a Sovereign Wealth Fund.",404,380
The current UK government has conceded the principle by proposing a natural resource fund for the benefit of the North of England.,404,381
The fund should be established when economic circumstances allow and should come under the ownership and management of the Scottish Parliament and Government.,404,382
"We will look to boost Scotlands rural economy by pressing for a fair share of the UKs CAP convergence uplift, which comes to the UK as a result of Scotlands low hectare rates.",703,383
The Scottish Government has prioritised Scotlands rural economy and is working to strengthen our rural and remote communities.,703,385
"This includes measures such as Road Equivalent Tariff,",703,386
a focus on the promotion of our food and drink sector,703,387
and key infrastructure investment such as the dualling of the A9.,411,388
"At Westminster, SNP MPs will seek the same level of commitment to our rural industries and communities.",703,389
"In particular, we will scrutinise UK government actions at an EU level to ensure that our farming and fishing industries receive full backing and support.",703,390
"Other measures, proposed in this manifesto, that will be of particular benefit to our rural economy and rural communities are:",703,391
"Protection of the Royal Mails Universal Service Obligation,",703,392
the maintenance of the 30 per cent government share of Royal Mail in order to protect the public interest,413,393
"and, over time, the return of the Royal Mail to public ownership.",413,394
The introduction of a Universal Service Obligation for broadband services,411,395
Increased investment in 4G,411,396
Taking forward Scotlands £1.3 billion rural development programme,703,397
Action at an EU level to deliver a simplified CAP,703,398
Work to ensure the discard ban is workable for our fishing fleet,703,399
Our commitment to ensure coastal communities benefit from the net income of the Crown Estates seabed leasing revenues,703,400
Pressing for a fair deal on fuel prices for rural areas,703,401
The full devolution of all food levies so we can support the promotion of Scotlands food and drink,301,402
"We will firmly oppose, and seek to reverse, the growing inequality in UK society",503,404
 inequality that acts as a dampener on growth and limits opportunity for people in communities across the country.,503,405
"That is why we must create a fair wage economy,",403,406
with higher wages for those on low and middle earnings translating into increased revenues for the Exchequer.,403,407
Underpinning this is our belief that everyone should have the opportunity of a good life in return for their effort and hard work.,403,408
Increasing the minimum wage and expanding the living wage will help deliver both a strong economy and a fairer society.,403,409
"Instead of the current, failed Westminster approach, which is based on the false belief that the fruits of economic growth trickle down, we believe that increasing the incomes of those lower down the income scale will deliver a more direct benefit for our economy, as well as improving quality of life for hardpressed households.",403,410
"This alternative approach sees all our citizens as valued contributors to society,",503,411
"with the impact of higher disposable incomes felt most significantly in local economies and our thousands of small and medium sized businesses, as well as in higher revenues.",403,412
We also propose different spending and taxation priorities.,403,413
"At a time when thousands of our citizens are forced to use food banks, there can be no doubt that spending billions on a new generation of nuclear weapons is unjustifiable.",105,414
"A vote for the SNP is a vote to halt progress on Trident renewal, delivering a saving of £100 billion over the next 35 years.",105,415
"Alongside this, we will back proposals to return the top rate of income tax in the UK to 50p.",403,416
We support a levy on tobacco firms,403,417
"and would also support proposals for a specific tax on properties valued at over £2 million,",403,418
"increases to the bank levy,",403,419
a bankers bonus tax,403,420
and a review of the pension tax relief available to the wealthiest.,403,421
"We would also call on the UK government to move forward cautiously with plans to increase the higher rate threshold to £50,000, ensuring first that tax revenues are sufficiently buoyant.",403,422
"We will look to ensure the public interest is fully protected in any future disposal of RBS and Lloyds shares, including decisions on how any windfall revenues should be used.",403,423
Its clear that action needs to be taken to ensure we have a tax system that is fit for the 21st century.,303,425
"We will back measures to tackle tax avoidance, including early legislation to address tax dodging and an increase in staff resources at HMRC.",303,426
We will put forward measures to strengthen antiavoidance law across the UK to ensure it is as strong as new Scottish legislation.,605,427
We will also support a review of controlled foreign companies exemptions,403,428
and favour a rolling review of tax reliefs as part of an ongoing programme of simplification of the tax system.,303,429
We support calls for a global fair tax summit to agree international measures to tackle tax abuses.,403,430
"Using the current powers of devolution, the SNP Scottish Government has taken forward policies designed to support households through the recession.",403,432
"For example, we have frozen the Council Tax,",403,433
removed prescription charges,504,434
"and road tolls,",403,435
"increased free nursery provision,",504,436
provided free school meals in the early years of primary school,504,437
and reintroduced free university education.,506,438
"Taken together, these measures have saved people across Scotland hundreds of pounds.",403,439
That includes pensioners saving an average £250 a year from concessionary travel or people with long term illnesses an average of £104 on prescription charges.,403,440
A vote for the SNP in May is a vote to protect these gains.,403,441
"As well as certainty on Council Tax bills, we have also placed limits on increases in rail fares and water charges.",403,442
Through tough and effective regulation of Scottish Water weve been able to deliver realterms cuts in water bills.,403,443
In the same way we wish to see a more robust approach to energy bills and believe Ofgem should be empowered to enforce price reductions to reflect lower wholesale costs as a result of lower oil prices.,403,444
"Consumers must see the benefit of lower wholesale costs in their bills, with savings of as much as £100 a year.",403,445
The Scottish Government and UK government should have joint oversight of Ofgem.,403,446
"We will continue to support older Scots, by retaining key policies such as the free bus pass and free personal care and well back the continuation of the free TV license.",504,448
"At Westminster, we will call for the pension triple lock to be retained, ensuring the State Pension increases each year in line with inflation, wages or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is higher.",504,449
"And, we will support for a Single Tier Pension rate of £160 per week.",504,450
We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit  introduced to reward people for saving for their pension.,504,451
We believe that there should be a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.,504,452
"And, given Scotlands colder climate, we will also resist any attempts to end the winter fuel allowance.",504,453
"We will continue to support the roll out of auto enrolment for occupational pensions and also back, in principle, proposals to give pensioners more flexibility over their pension pots.",504,454
"However, we must ensure adequate levels of advice and support.",504,455
"We will work with pensioner groups to identify and target unfair, hidden pension charges.",504,456
Westminster has presided over a relentless undermining of our social security system.,504,458
The SNP is determined to target the worst and most damaging welfare changes introduced by the current government,504,459
"and to address issues such as zerohour contracts, which create unacceptable levels of uncertainty and financial insecurity for often low paid workers.",403,460
"We will support efforts in the next parliament to end unfair and exploitative zerohour contracts,",403,461
"with a timelimited consultation, which fully involves businesses and the trade unions, to agree the most effective way forward.",405,462
SNP MPs will vote for the complete abolition of the bedroom tax.,504,463
This will mean that the £35 million that the Scottish Government spends on mitigating its impact will be available for other purposes.,504,464
We would invest that money to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.,504,465
We also back increases of at least the cost of living in welfare benefits and believe the roll out of both Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit should be halted.,504,466
We will aim to reverse the replacement of Disability Living Allowance with PIP.,504,467
We will also oppose the £3 billion cut in disability support.,504,468
"In addition, we have given assurances to people already supported by the Independent Living Fund that support will continue.",504,469
We will also support an urgent review of the system of assessments for disability benefits.,504,470
"The current tapers for Universal Credit have been set too low, which means claimants will still be caught in the benefits trap, with clear financial disincentives in place for work.",504,471
"We believe there should be an increase in the work allowance, to deliver a significant boost to the incomes of people moving into work, helping to lift them and their families out of poverty.",504,472
We will also support an overhaul of the Work Capability Assessments.,504,473
"These are still delivering too many poor decisions, which are overturned on appeal, creating real hardship for households.",504,474
"We will demand an urgent review of the conditionality and sanctions regime, in order to deliver an overhaul of the current, deeply ineffective arrangements, which impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society.",504,475
The review will take particular account of the needs of people with mental health issues.,504,476
"We will seek to establish an approach that is proportionate and ethical, that recognises the particular challenges facing some individuals, and that avoids excessive or blanket measures which penalise those looking for work.",504,477
"The removal of cash benefits should be a last, rather than a first, resort.",504,478
We will support an increase in Carers' Allowance so that it matches Jobseekers' Allowance.,504,479
Those in receipt of Carers' Allowance will benefit by almost £600 per year.,504,480
"We will also press for the introduction, in Scotland, of a pilot programme of carers leave.",504,481
"We will not support attempts to restrict housing benefit for 18 to 21 year olds and believe exemptions to the Shared Accommodation Rate should be extended, for example, to cover all ages.",504,482
We believe that those who have been injured in the service of our country should get the full value of any war disablement pension and so will ensure that it is not treated as income in the assessment of entitlement to other benefits.,504,483
Ending fuel poverty has also been a key campaign for the SNP at Westminster for decades.,403,484
"In this next Parliament, we will seek action to ensure that those using prepayment meters have access to the same lower energy prices available to those using other payment methods.",403,485
"We will also press the UK government to ensure that pensioners whose homes are off grid receive their winter fuel allowances earlier, so they can take advantage of lower prices earlier in the year.",504,486
This election is an opportunity for Scotland to have real influence to deliver important gains and protections.,301,488
"On a wide range of issues, Scottish values and priorities can carry real weight at Westminster.",602,489
"We will press the UK government to work with the business community on mechanisms to formalise the relationship between government, employer associations and employee associations with a particular focus on encouraging wider trade union participation and recognising the positive role that can be played by collective bargaining in improving labour market conditions.",405,491
Evidence from the OECD shows that stronger trade unions tend to reduce inequality in labour income and ensure a more equal distribution of earnings.,405,492
"We support increased employee representation on company boards, believing that this can help bolster longterm decisionmaking and improve industrial relations.",405,493
We will urge the UK government to consult on how best to deliver such an increase.,405,494
"We will seek to reverse recent changes, which reduced key aspects of workers rights.",405,495
"For example, we will press for the restoration of a 90 days consultation period for redundancies affecting 100 or more employees.",405,496
"In addition, we will also oppose Tory plans to further restrict the right to strike",405,497
"and support trade unions with their proposals to modernise the way strike ballots are undertaken, with safe and secure online voting to maximise participation.",405,498
"We will use our influence at Westminster to ensure the UK matches, and supports, Scotlands ambitious commitments to carbon reduction",501,501
and that both Scotland and the UK are able to play a constructive role at this years UN Climate Change Conference.,501,502
"And, we will call on the UK government to match the approach of the Scottish Government with a dedicated Climate Justice Fund.",501,503
"We will seek to maximise support for offshore wind, including by seeking alterations to the current Contracts for Differences (CFD) regime to ensure that support is given to the offshore wind sector to not only generate renewable energy",501,505
but also to boost manufacturing opportunities and ensure Scotland sees maximum investment.,501,506
Allocations from the next round of CFD should be made early and projects in Scotland should be prioritised and receive their fair share of funding.,501,507
We want to see a longterm commitment to the development of this industry.,501,508
"We will continue to argue for changes to ensure that Scottish renewables, and Scotlands islands, are not penalised because of their distance from markets in the south of England.",501,509
"We believe that transmission arrangements should work to support, rather than undermine, production of renewable energy in the most favourable locations.",501,510
And we will press for onshore wind to continue to receive support through the lifetime of the next Parliament.,501,511
Our ambition is not limited to wind.,501,512
We want the UK government to remove barriers that are limiting growth in the hydro sector,501,513
and believe there should be additional support for pump hydro and Carbon Capture and Storage schemes.,501,514
We also wish to see a big expansion in community heating schemes and believe the Renewable Heat Incentive should continue beyond 2015.,501,515
The Scottish Government has ambitious targets to support community energy generation and we will press the UK government to make it simpler for communities to establish local energy companies and easier for community schemes to access the grid.,403,516
"While responsibility for animal welfare is devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the SNP in government is already working to improve the conditions of kept animals, including consultations on responsible dog ownership",501,518
"and wild animals in travelling circuses,",501,519
"and giving consideration to further protection at slaughter,",501,520
the registration or licensing of horse establishments,501,521
and a review of tail docking in working dogs at Westminster,501,522
we will support further animal welfare measures with a global focus.,501,523
This includes action to end the illegal ivory trade and protect species such as polar bears and bluefin tuna.,501,524
Scotland is an outward looking nation.,602,526
"We have family in all parts of the world and our society has been strengthened, over generations, by new Scots arriving from across the globe.",602,527
"This is part of who we are and provides untold benefits, socially, culturally and economically.",602,528
That is why we must do all we can to prevent increasingly insular attitudes at Westminster from shutting Scotland off from the world.,602,529
"Backing the Scottish Governments international strategy The Scottish Governments international strategy is based on three core elements participation, promotion and protection and these will be central to our approach at Westminster.",107,530
"We expect the UK government to participate fully in international institutions, to respect their role and to work with them.",107,531
This includes the UK fulfilling all its international obligations.,107,532
The UKs standing in the world has been damaged by our involvement in the illegal war in Iraq.,105,533
"We wish to see proper oversight and approval for any future UK military action, which would need to be in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and approved by Parliament.",105,534
We will call on the next UK government to pursue a two state solution for Israel and Palestine and to support the formal recognition of a Palestinian state.,106,535
"The European Union is far from perfect, however we believe that it is overwhelmingly in Scotlands interests for us to remain a member,",108,537
"engaging with the institutions as fully as we can, and to argue for reform from within.",108,538
"We will oppose UK withdrawal from the EU and will propose that, in any future referendum there should be a double majority requirement.",108,539
Each of the four constituent nations of the UK would have to vote for withdrawal before the UK as a whole could leave the European Union.,108,540
"We believe there should be a greater role for devolved administrations in the Council of Ministers and more direct engagement in devolved policy areas, across the full range of European institutions.",108,541
"We will seek a Cooperation Agreement between the UK government and devolved administrations, which will include formal agreement on speaking rights for Scottish ministers and direct Scottish input into the development of UK policy on key EU issues.",108,542
We support free movement within the EU and recognise both the contribution EU citizens make to Scottish society and the opportunities created for Scottish citizens elsewhere in the EU.,108,543
"We also support Scottish participation in the European Arrest warrant, a measure that makes it easier to bring to justice criminals who have fled to other EU jurisdictions.",108,544
"We will also seek an explicit exemption for the NHS and Scottish Water, as part of a general public sector exemption, from the terms of the proposed TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.",110,545
"Today, Scottish international aid investment is making a big difference to thousands of lives in some of the worlds most disadvantaged communities.",107,547
We have long supported the United Nations target to spend 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI) on international development and will continue to support UK spending at this level,107,548
" which must be calculated on current, not former, measurements of GNI.",107,549
"As part of a commitment to focus on aid quality, we believe that overseas aid funding should not be used for defence related expenditure",105,550
and should not undermine public services in developing countries.,107,551
"And, we are in favour of an audit of outstanding debt owed by developing countries, with debt relief provided as appropriate.",107,552
"SNP MPs will also make the case for the establishment of a special envoy a diplomatic post within the Foreign Office to promote the rights of LGBTI people throughout the word, as an integral part of UK foreign policy.",201,553
"As a northern European nation, our near neighbourhood including the High North and Arctic are a key priority for Scotland.",107,556
"The forthcoming UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) must take full account of the particular challenges and opportunities of the northern regional dimension,",104,557
"and of the need to be more effective at combatting cyberterrorism where the SDSR must lay out a clear strategy,",104,558
including continued engagement with the Scottish Government.,301,559
"The SDSR must review the current Ministry of Defence record, which includes falsely inflating spending commitments, mismanaging Army personnel reforms and creating dangerous capability gaps.",104,560
"In particular, we believe there should be ocean going conventional patrol vessels based permanently in Scotland",104,561
and will seek the early procurement of multirole Maritime Patrol Aircraft purchased off the shelf by the end of this parliament and operating from Scotland.,104,562
The SDSR must also fully consider the advantages of a defence policy without weapons of mass destruction and wasting £100bn renewing Trident.,105,563
We will continue in our principled opposition to nuclear weapons and believe that the UK should abandon plans to renew the Trident nuclear missile system.,105,564
"In addition, the MoD should also publish in full current and projected annual costs of the Trident system and its proposed successor programme, including nuclear weapons throughlife costs.",105,565
"UK policy has seen reductions in conventional footprint in Scotland, leading to a significant underspend, meaning fewer jobs and less defence related spending to benefit local economies.",104,567
Existing conventional bases in Scotland should be retained and all conventional rebasing activities should be completed by the end of this parliament.,104,568
There should be no further erosion of the Scottish regiments,104,569
and it remains our ambition to see the traditional regiments restored.,104,570
"We support greater transparency in UK defence spending, with a full breakdown of spending by nation and region in the UK, including all procurement and SME expenditure and a full breakdown of component costs of all major projects by location.",104,572
With taxpayers in Scotland contributing billions of pounds more than the MOD currently spends in Scotland we believe that a far larger proportion of the defence procurement budget should be spent in Scotland.,104,573
There should be a strategy developed by the MOD to ensure more small and medium sized enterprises in Scotland are part of the manufacturing support chain for major defence projects.,104,574
The Type 26 frigates must be built in Scotland and the Aircraft Carriers refitted at Rosyth.,104,575
"The duty of care to our service personnel, veterans and their families must be a key priority.",104,577
The MoD should provide much better support to next of kin and bereaved families in the event of a loss of a serving relative.,104,578
"As a matter of safety, we believe a collision warning system should be installed on Tornado and Typhoon aircraft as quickly as possible.",104,579
We also support giving Armed Forces representative bodies a statutory footing.,104,580
There is no doubt that Fixed Odds Betting Terminals cause harm and hardship in communities across Scotland.,503,582
"Thats why the Scottish Government needs legislative powers to control the growth and impact of these machines,",403,583
and we believe the UK government should devolve these powers in full.,301,584
The problem of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals is linked to the proliferation of betting shops in some communities and so we will continue to argue for Scotland to have full responsibility for the regulation of gambling.,403,585
"We will also seek new powers so we can effectively regulate payday lenders in Scotlands communities, building on the recommendations of the Smith Commission and going beyond proposals set out so far by the current UK government.",403,586
"We do not support Tory plans for the reintroduction of the so called snoopers charter, which would see all online activity of every person in the UK stored for a year.",605,588
"Instead, we need a proportionate response to extremism.",605,589
"That is why we will support targeted, and properly overseen, measures to identify suspected extremists and, if necessary, examine their online activity and communications.",605,590
"We believe that responsibility for broadcasting in Scotland should transfer from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament and we will support moves to more devolved arrangements for the BBC with greater powers and funding for the different national and regional broadcasting areas, such as BBC Scotland.",301,592
"We believe that the licence fee should be retained with any replacement system,",502,593
"which should be based primarily on the ability to pay, in place by the end of the next BBC Charter period.",503,594
"BBC Scotland should receive a fairer share of BBC income, reflecting more accurately the licence fee revenue raised here in Scotland.",301,595
"This would provide a boost of over £100 million, which we believe will provide important new opportunities for production companies and the creative sector in Scotland.",502,596
The Scottish Government and Parliament should have a substantial role at all stages in the review of the BBC Charter and we will work to ensure that any new governance arrangements for the BBC better reflect Scotlands interests.,301,597
It should also be for the Scottish Government to decide which sporting events in Scotland should be included in the list of those that are free to view in Scotland.,502,598
Regulation of print media is already devolved.,301,599
"The Scottish Parliament chose, on a cross party basis, to support the UK Governments actions to implement Leveson.",301,600
"We will consider carefully the results of the first year review and work with other parties, in Scotland and at Westminster, to ensure effective regulation of the media on a nonpolitical basis.",301,601
We will press the UK government to reinstate an emergency towing vehicle on the west coast of Scotland and to ensure that delays in recruitment dont leave vital coastguard stations understaffed.,301,603
"We will seek a commitment for the earliest possible return of the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre to Kinloss, so that search and rescue operations can be coordinated in Scotland.",301,604
This election gives us a rare opportunity to begin to repair what is an increasingly broken political system in the UK.,202,606
We need to make clear to those who wield power that they do so only with the consent of the people.,202,607
Almost every aspect of the system needs an overhaul.,202,608
That includes an effective power of recall for MPs.,202,609
"We will continue to work with others, across the political parties, to deliver a system that gives real power to voters to remove MPs who have forfeited the trust of their electors.",202,610
We also badly need a fair voting system for UK elections.,202,611
"The electoral system means political focus is on the interests of a small number of swing voters in marginal seats, and that has meant the economic and social needs of areas like the north of England, Scotland, the West Midlands and Wales have been forgotten.",202,612
"The SNP supports the Single Transferable Vote, a system that makes sure every vote and every part of the country counts.",202,613
"Of course, the second chamber of the UK parliament is not even elected and continues to have hereditary members who have a greater say in the future of Scotlands defence or welfare system than the elected members of the Scottish Parliament.",204,614
The SNP believes the House of Lords should be scrapped and replaced with a fully elected second chamber.,204,615
Given the successful inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds in the independence vote the Scottish Parliament is legislating to ensure they also have the vote in Holyrood elections.,202,616
We believe 16 and 17 year olds should be given the vote in UK general and European elections and will work with future governments to secure this change,202,617
We  support  strict  rules  on  lobbying  but  believe  that campaigning  charities  should  be  allowed  straightforward  access  and  restrictions  on  their  activities  as nonparty  campaigners  should  be  removed.,202,619
"Scotlands new First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, has given a very clear signal of the need to have more equal representation of men and women in public life.",202,621
The Scottish Cabinet is one of only three cabinets in the developed world to have an equal number of men and women,202,622
"and, with the necessary powers devolved, we will take forward proposals to ensure 50 per cent female representation on public boards.",202,623
We will press for the same step to be taken for UK wide public bodies and will also encourage the new UK government to work with the private sector to increase the number of women represented at the most senior levels in our major companies.,202,624
"We will support the tightening of the law on maternity discrimination, with legislation introduced within the first year of a new UK government.",201,625
We have also called for early action on Equal Pay audits for larger companies to ensure women are getting the salaries they are entitled to.,201,626
"We will demand that section 78 of the Equalities Act 2010 is commenced and that regulations to compel employers of more than 250 people to publish annual gender pay gap information, starting in 201617, are consulted on and brought into law.",201,627
"We are determined to ensure a fairer deal for women, not only in the work place.",503,629
Thats why well address a longstanding failure in our tax system by demanding that VAT on sanitary products is removed.,503,630
"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a luxury, and should not be taxed.",503,631
"With powers over equalities devolved, we would bring forward an Equal Pay (Scotland) Bill to finally deliver equal pay law that works for women in Scotland.",201,632
It is unacceptable 45 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970 that the gender pay gap remains.,201,633
"This would include consultation on how new regulations or structures can be created by the Bill to expedite the equal pay claims process, and ensure that settlements are enforced quickly.",201,634
We will seek to maintain the protections provided by the Equality Act 2010 and will ask the government to engage with key stakeholders on potential improvements.,201,635
We will also support calls to establish a Race Committee to advise the work of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.,201,636
"In addition, we will ask the UK government to conduct an early review of the current immigration detention system and regime, in order to deliver a fairer and more effective system as we move forward.",201,637
"Given the central place of human rights in Scotlands constitutional settlement, and their importance at the heart of our politics, we will oppose scrapping the Human Rights Act",201,638
or withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights.,108,639
"Too often in recent years, decisions by governments at Westminster have undermined the ability of the Scottish Government to deliver as much as it would wish.",301,641
"This has included budget cuts as a result of austerity, questionable application of the Barnett Formula and long delays in giving approval for Scottish Government proposals, for example the mechanism to mitigate the Bedroom Tax in Scotland.",301,642
A strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster can do more to ensure that the UK government is not standing in the way of progress for Scotland.,301,643
"At the heart of this manifesto is our commitment to move away from the damaging austerity agenda of the current UK government, so that we can protect Scotlands public services from future Tory cuts and protect the progress that has been delivered by tens of thousands of dedicated public sector staff.",301,645
"In health, with the SNP, the number of staff working in Scotlands NHS has risen to a record high, with over 10,000 more people now working in the NHS.",504,646
"These staff have delivered shorter waiting times, including in vitally important areas such as cancer treatment.",504,647
"While there is still work to do, the number of people starting treatment for cancer within 62 days of referral has risen from 84.5 per cent in 2007 to 94.2 per cent.",504,648
"Nearly twothirds of people in Scotland now say they are satisfied with our health service, according to the most recent survey, compared to just twofifths in 2005.",504,649
"In our schools, against every main measure, education is getting better.",506,650
"We have record exam results and record high number of school leavers in either work, training or further or higher education.",506,651
The number of P1 pupils in Scotland taught in classes of more than 25 has fallen to just 451 this year,506,652
" 97 per cent lower than the 16,845 children recorded in 2006.",506,653
"And the proportion of schools reported as being in good or satisfactory condition has increased again, to 83 per cent  up from 61 per cent in April 2007.",506,654
That means the number of pupils in poor or bad buildings has more than halved since 2007.,506,655
"Since the election of the SNP government in 2007: There has been an increase of over 2,300 nurses and midwives in Scotland and 2,350 doctors",504,657
More than 320 extra GPs work in our communities,504,658
"and there are almost 1,350 more consultants providing specialist care in our NHS,",504,659
including a 170 per cent increase in A&E consultants,504,660
Weve seen an 8.8 per cent increase in the number of paramedics,504,661
while the number of senior managers in the NHS is down 29 per cent.,504,662
Weve  protected  NHS  spending  against Westminster  austerity    and  we  will  argue  for increases  in  health  spending  across  the  UK  of £9.5  billion  above  inflation  by  202021   £24 billion  in  total.,504,663
This  will  deliver  a  total  increase for  NHS  Scotland  of  £2  billion  by  202021.,504,664
And in our communities people are feeling safer.,605,665
The crime clear up rate is the highest since comparable records began in 1976 and recorded crime has fallen for the seventh year in a row and is now at its lowest level for 40 years.,605,666
Weve also acted to tackle the scourge of knife crime.,605,667
The average prison sentence for handling an offensive weapon in Scotland is now three times higher than in 200405.,605,668
Crimes of handling an offensive weapon (including knives) have reduced by 62 per cent since 200607.,605,669
Under the SNP Government at Holyrood: Tuition fees have been scrapped  and more young people than ever before are going to university,506,671

the more powers we have in Scotland the more we can achieve for the people who live here.,301,905
That is why we campaigned for a Scottish Parliament and voted for the Scotland Act 1998.,301,906
"It is why we supported the limited extension of devolution in the Scotland Act 2012, and called for a far more substantial package of powers at that point.",301,907
The same principle underpins our continued support for independence and was at the heart of our campaign for a Yes vote in September 2014.,301,908
"During the referendum, the parties campaigning for a No vote promised the people of Scotland substantial new powers for our parliament,",301,909
"amounting to real Home Rule, maximum devolution and as close to federalism as was possible.",301,910
"It is our intention to hold them to that promise and the more SNP MPs elected in May, the greater our ability to deliver the strong package of effective devolution that people in Scotland want and need to build a fairer and more prosperous country.",301,911
"We welcome the proposals set out in the Smith Commission, as far as they go.",301,912

in particular over the welfare system.,504,915
"We share the view of many organisations across Scotland that the package, as it stands, does not enable us to deliver fully either the greater social justice",503,916
or the powerhouse economy that our country demands.,410,917
"As the STUC has said, there is not enough in the Smith Commission recommendations to empower the Scottish Parliament to tackle inequality in Scotland"".",301,918
"And, we agree with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) that anything less than wholesale devolution of welfare would be a real missed opportunity to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people in our communities.",301,919
"The Smith Commission proposals were, in many respects, a missed opportunity.",301,920
Decisions about more than 70 per cent of Scottish taxes and 85 per cent of current UK welfare spending in Scotland will stay at Westminster.,301,921
"Instead of limited and unambitious proposals on tax powers, we should have a greater ability to generate economic growth,",410,922
deliver more employment opportunities,701,923
and support family incomes with the devolution of additional taxes.,503,924
"Instead of leaving decisions on wages and employment with Westminster, devolving these key areas to Scotland means we could ensure that people in Scotland receive fair pay for a days work.",701,925
"We could bring together, more effectively, skills development and employment support  enabling us to get more people into wellpaid and rewarding employment, closer to home.",701,926
"And, instead of choices on most aspects of our welfare system remaining at Westminster, the full devolution of the welfare state would give us the ability to halt the cruelest and most damaging welfare changes and instead develop a system that supports people and families in their time of need.",504,927
"It is only with the more extensive devolution of welfare, wages, taxation and the economy that we can deliver greater prosperity for more of our citizens and for Scotland as a whole.",301,928
"Our focus, therefore, will be securing specific new economic and social powers, over and above those set out in the Smith Commission proposals,",301,930
so we can tailor policy to make much more of the countrys strengths and finally address the challenges that we face as a society.,301,931
"Scotland should have the opportunity to establish its own constitutional framework, including human rights, equalities and the place of local government.",204,932
The Scottish Parliament should also have the ability to directly represent its interests on devolved matters in the EU and internationally.,301,933
"With more meaningful tax powers, we could provide more incentives and support for businesses to invest in Scotland",402,934
"and enter new markets overseas,",402,935
encouraging inward investment and boosting our international exports.,402,936
"We could also use targeted changes in business tax allowances to encourage higher levels of investment in capital or Research & Development, and encourage the growth of SMEs.",301,937
"Proper economic powers would enable a fully cohesive industrial strategy focused on strengthening manufacturing and boosting innovation, allowing us to revitalise Scotlands industries and rebalance our economy.",410,938
Full control over social protection would allow the Scottish Parliament to tailor a new and fairer welfare system for Scotland.,504,939
"For example, no Scottish Government would have introduced the Bedroom Tax in Scotland and, looking forward, we would be able to protect people from any future ideological attacks from Westminster on the very essence of our social security system.",504,940
"Devolving employment policy would allow us to take progressive action on low pay in order to tackle poverty and inequality,",503,941
"with the power to raise the minimum wage, regardless of the political balance at Westminster",412,942
and we could more closely integrate skills and employment policy to support people in their search for rewarding work.,701,943
We will use the influence of SNP votes at Westminster to ensure that the promises made to Scotland during the referendum are delivered.,301,945
"We will demand, firstly, that the proposals of the Smith Commission are delivered quickly and in full.",301,946
"However, we believe that the proposals of the Smith Commission do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.",301,947
We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.,301,948
"As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals and the Scotland Act 2012 have demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would require to underpin it would take a number of years to complete.",301,949
SNP MPs will work with the Scottish Government to secure the best deal for Scotland in these negotiations.,301,950
"In the meantime, we will prioritise devolution of powers over employment policy, including the minimum wage,",301,951
"welfare,",504,952
"business taxes, national insurance",402,953
and equality policy,503,954
"the powers we need to create jobs,",701,955
grow revenues,410,956
and lift people out of poverty.,503,957
"As we set out in our submission to the Smith Commission, the Barnett Formula should continue to be used to determine Scotland's resources during the transition to full fiscal responsibility and for as long as the Scottish Parliament's financial powers fall short of full responsibility.",301,958
This General Election is an exciting opportunity for Scotland to have real power at Westminster.,301,960
The SNP goes into this election with a clear message none of us can afford more austerity//.,409,961
"Our NHS, our economy and our children can't afford the billions of pounds of additional cuts that the Tories, Labour and Liberals have signed up to.",409,962
And none of us can afford the £100 billion they plan to spend on new nuclear weapons.,105,963
The Westminster parties have the wrong priorities.,301,964
And it will be ordinary people across the UK who will pay the price.,503,965
Unless you choose differently.,301,966
Labour alone won't be bold enough to deliver the change ordinary people need.,305,967
A big team of SNP MPs can force the pace of progressive change.,301,968
We offer an alternative.,301,969
A responsible plan for modest spending increases,409,970
"and real investment in the NHS, housing, childcare",504,971
and jobs.,701,972
An SNP vote on May 7th will be a vote to make Scotland's voice heard loudly and clearly.,301,973

We abolished prescription charges in 2011.,504,39

We have increased the availability of free early years education and childcare from 12.5 hours in 2007 to 16 hours a week for all three and four year olds  and also extended it to two year olds from low income households.,504,42

social protections,504,71
and family budgets from the impact of Tory cuts.,603,72

Setting rates of income tax is now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.,301,84
"In the current financial year, we have frozen the basic rate of income tax to help low and middle earners",701,85
- and we have opted not to cut tax for higher rate taxpayers through an increase in the higher rate threshold.,704,86
"Until such time as the Scottish Parliament controls the rules on income tax avoidance, there is a risk that an increase in the Additional Rate of income tax in Scotland alone would lead to a loss of revenue.",605.1,87
"However, we support an increase in the Additional Rate from 45p to 50p across the UK as a whole from 2018/19.",503,88
"At a time when household budgets are under increasing pressure, SNP MPs will oppose any proposed increases in Value Added Tax or National Insurance.",701,89

Our plan to end austerity would enable the UK government to increase investment in the NHS far beyond current plans.,504,95

SNP MPs will also call for tough new action to close the gender pay gap.,503,135
We must make sure that our interests are not ignored in the Brexit negotiations - a vote for the SNP will make sure that Scotlands voice is heard.,301,137

"However, if the SNP wins this election, we will demand a place for Scotland at the Brexit negotiating table and the inclusion of the case for our place in the Single Market in the UKs negotiating remit.",301,142
"At the end of the Brexit process, when the final terms of the deal are known, it is right that Scotland should have a choice about our future.",301,144
Brexit must not simply be imposed on Scotland no matter how damaging it turns out to be.,301,145
Last years Holyrood election delivered the democratic mandate for an independence referendum.,202.4,146
The recent vote of Scotlands national Parliament has underlined that mandate.,301,147
"If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats in this election, that would complete a triple lock, further reinforcing the democratic mandate which already exists.",301,148
"And, in such circumstances, any continued Tory attempts to block the people of Scotland having a choice on their future - when the time is right and the options are clear - would be democratically unsustainable.",301,149

SNP MPs will demand an end to austerity.,504,230
"We will demand a new, credible fiscal plan for the UK.",408,231
The UK governments current fiscal plans are driven more by ideology and their own political interests than the interests of the country.,305.1,232
They intend to build up a financial war-chest ahead of the next election  and they will do it on the back of the poorest in society by slashing welfare.,504,233
This is neither morally acceptable nor economically necessary.,504,234
Our alternative fiscal plan has three key aims: Balance the budget by the end of the Parliament,414,235
We will propose to achieve a current budget balance by the end of the next Parliament in 2021/22,414,236
with net borrowing being used only for investment from that year onwards.,414,237
Return the deficit to its pre-crash long-term average,414,238
"Under our plans, the UKs net borrowing requirement will fall to 2.3 per cent of GDP  the thirty-year, long-term average for net borrowing prior to the financial crisis.",414,239
It will reach this level in 2020/21 and remain there in 2021/22.,414,240
Set debt on a downward path from 2019/20,414,241
"These steps will see debt falling as a percentage of GDP from 2019/20, meeting the current target on public sector net debt.",414,242
"This plan will release almost £120 billion for public spending over the next Parliament,",504,243
"while returning the UKs finances to a stable, sustainable path.",414,244
"We will back tax proposals that promote fairness,",503,253
while raising the revenues required to protect the public services we all rely on.,504,254
Setting rates of Income Tax is now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.,301,255
"In the current financial year, we have frozen the basic rate of Income Tax to help low and middle earners",701,256
- and we have opted not to cut tax for higher rate taxpayers through an increase in the higher rate threshold.,408,257
"Until such time as the Scottish Parliament controls the rules on income tax avoidance, there is a risk that an increase in the additional rate of Income Tax in Scotland alone would lead to a loss of revenue.",408,258
"However, we support an increase in the Additional Rate from 45p to 50p across the UK as a whole from 2018/19.",503,259

"We will back the continuation of VAT-exemption on essential items like childrens clothes,",403,265
and will hold the UK government to a commitment to remove VAT from sanitary products.,403,266
"Until VAT is removed from sanitary products, SNP MPs will call for Scotlands population share of the Tampon Tax Fund to be transferred to the Scottish Government so that a fair and proportionate amount can be distributed to organisations working with and for women across Scotland.",503,267
SNP MPs will back improvements to tax collection,303,269
"and tougher action on tax avoidance, including:",605.1,270
a moratorium and review of the closure of HMRC offices in Scotland and across the UK;,303,271
beneficial ownership of companies and trusts to be made public;,403,272
measures to improve the transparency of tax paid by major international companies;,403,273
and further action by the UK government to tackle international tax avoidance.,605.1,274
We all rely on our NHS  that is why we are committed to making sure it is fit for the future.,504,276
The SNP Scottish Government is already committed to an increase in the NHS revenue budget of £500 million more than inflation by the end of the current term of the Scottish Parliament.,504,277
That means the budget will increase by £2 billion in total.,504,278
Latest statistics show that overall health spending in Scotland is around 7 per cent per head higher than in England.,504,279
"If the UK government were to match Scotland, Englands Health investment would increase by over £11 billion above inflation by the end of this Parliament.",504,280
"At Westminster, SNP MPs will argue for an increase in frontline health spending  and the Scottish Government will ensure that any consequential funding from this goes to Scotlands health service.",504,281
We will always vote to protect the health service in all parts of the UK from privatisation  as any moves to privatise the NHS in England could lead to the erosion of the budget that is available to Scotland.,504,282
We will work on a cross-party basis to support an NHS Reinstatement Bill that returns the NHS south of the border to its founding principles.,504,283
We are committed to an NHS that is free to those who need it.,504,284
"That is why we abolished prescription charges in Scotland in 2011 , ensuring there is no tax on ill health.",504,285
We remain committed to free prescriptions.,504,286
Scotlands population is changing and our health service must change with it.,504,287
To meet the challenge of an ageing population an additional £1 .7 billion will be invested in Scotlands health and social care partnerships over this term of the Scottish Parliament.,504,288
We are also reforming primary care and increasing the share of the total NHS budget that is committed to it - this will support an increase in the numbers of GPs and nurses working in our communities.,504,289
"In Scotland, we are taking new action to promote health and well-being in childrens early years.",504,290
"We are increasing the number of health visitors,",504,291
"introducing the Baby Box for every new-born child,",504,292
and delivering the Childsmile programme to improve oral health.,504,293
We are also developing and implementing the Child and Adolescent Health and Wellbeing Strategy.,504,294
"Obesity is one of the biggest challenges facing our nations health, but the UK governments strategy falls short on key measures to make meaningful progress.",504,295

and introducing clearer food labelling.,403,298

"One in four of us experience mental health issues in our lifetime, so there is much still to do.",504,302
Our new ten-year Mental Health Strategy includes 40 different actions  based around improving access to services and supporting earlier intervention.,504,303
Actions include increasing the mental health workforce and improving delivery of child and adolescent mental health services.,504,304
"In contrast to the approach of the UK government, the Scottish Government values junior doctors, nurses and our wider NHS workforce.",701,305
We have committed to enshrining safe NHS staffing levels in law.,701,306
The Scottish Government has supported NHS workers through a difficult time of pay restraint with additional measures to tackle low pay,701,307
and support progression.,411,308
"As a result, many nurses and Agenda for Change staff are better paid than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK.",701,309
"However, we recognise that at a time of rising inflation, public sector pay caps become increasingly unsustainable.",701,310
"For the NHS, the Scottish Government will work with unions to submit evidence to the independent pay review body on the impact of pay restraint and ask it to make fair recommendations.",701,311
And we will commit - as we always have done - to implementing the recommendations of the pay review body in full.,701,312

The Oil and Gas Institute at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen has estimated that leaving the EU is likely to cost the North Sea oil and gas supply chain £200 million a year in tariffs and export taxes.,407,501

And we will stand firm against the demonisation of migrants.,602.2,520
Throughout the Brexit process the UK government has treated EU nationals living in the UK as bargaining chips.,108,521
"It is shameful, and it must end.",108,522

"We will continue to make the case for the reintroduction of a Post-Study Work Visa scheme for Scotland, to enable international students who come here to study to then stay and contribute to our society and economy after they graduate.",602.2,525
"The UK government recently introduced a Skills Immigration Charge  a charge for employers, including the public sector, of £1,000 per non-EEA worker per year.",602.2,526
"This fee will lead to skills shortages,",411,527
harm our economy,410,528
and remove funding from frontline public services.,504,529

"SNP MPs will oppose any such moves, and press for the charge to be scrapped altogether.",602.2,531

This election is about the kind of country we want to Scotland to be.,601.1,549
"More than ever, Scotland needs strong voices in Westminster, standing up for the values we hold dear.",601.1,550
A vote for the SNP is a vote to ensure Scotlands future is in Scotlands hands  not in the hands of Westminster Tories.,301,551
We will oppose any attempts by the Tories to water-down the vital rights currently protected by EU membership.,201.2,552
"We will stand up for Scotlands place in Europe,",108,553
and we will make sure Scotlands voice is heard in the Brexit negotiations.,301,554
This election wont decide whether or not Scotland will be independent.,301,556
But a vote for the SNP is a vote to reinforce the Scottish Parliaments right to decide when an independence referendum should happen.,301,557
"At the end of the Brexit process, when the final terms of the deal are known, it is right that Scotland should have a real choice about our future.",301,558
Brexit must not simply be imposed on Scotland no matter how damaging it turns out to be.,301,559
Last years Holyrood election delivered the democratic mandate for an independence referendum in these circumstances.,202.4,560
The recent vote of Scotlands national Parliament has underlined that mandate.,202.4,561
"If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats in this election, that would complete a triple lock, further reinforcing the democratic mandate which already exists.",202.4,562
"And, in such circumstances, any continued Tory attempts to block the people of Scotland having a choice on their future, when the options are clear, and on a timescale determined by the Scottish Parliament, would be democratically unsustainable.",202.4,563
"The SNP believes that if Scotland chooses to become independent, we should be a member state of the EU.",108,565

"We will continue, in all circumstances, to demand the scrapping or fundamental reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and support Scottish control of Scottish fisheries, as we have done for many years.",703.1,567
We will also oppose any attempt by the UK government to treat the fishing industry as a bargaining chip.,703.1,568
"Having sold out fishing as expendable on the way in to the EU, a Tory government must not be allowed to betray it again on the way out.",703.1,569
"Given that an independence referendum would happen at the end of the Brexit process, this election also presents Scotland with a more immediate opportunity.",301,570
"In the months ahead, we must make sure that our interests are not ignored in the Brexit negotiations.",301,571
A vote for the SNP will make sure that Scotlands voice is heard.,301,572
A majority of people in Scotland voted to remain in the EU - but even many of those who voted to leave have real concerns about the extreme Brexit being pursued by the UK government.,301,573
"To be taken out, not just of the EU, but also of the Single Market, poses a real and present danger to Scottish jobs - to our farmers and fisherman, our universities, our food and drink businesses and to almost every sector of our economy.",108,574
"Indeed, it has been estimated that leaving the Single Market could cost 80,000 jobs in Scotland.",701,575
"That is why the Scottish Government published compromise proposals that would keep Scotland in the Single Market, even as we left the EU.",108,576
These proposals were rejected out of hand by the UK government.,108,577
"Despite promising to listen to the devolved administrations, and being prepared to countenance a special deal for the car industry, they refused to consider arrangements that would address the specific needs of Scotland.",301,578
"However, this election offers people the chance to give the Scottish Governments proposals real democratic legitimacy and make it impossible for the Prime Minister to continue to ignore Scotlands voice.",301,579
"If the SNP wins the election, it will give us a mandate to demand a place for Scotland at the Brexit negotiating table",301,580
and the inclusion of the case for our place in the Single Market in the UKs negotiating remit.,108,581
"Brexit threatens the fundamental rights that people in the UK currently enjoy, including workers rights, as well as vital social and environmental protections.",108,583
SNP MPs will hold the Tories to account to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished after the UK leaves.,201.2,584
We will also seek a cast-iron guarantee from the UK government that they will seek the consent of the Scottish Parliament under the Sewel Convention to the terms of the Brexit Bill.,202.1,585
"The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is enshrined in the Scotland Act 1998, ensuring that human rights are protected by the Scottish Government and all Scottish legislation.",201.2,586
"The SNP re-affirms its commitment to the Council of Europe, the ECHR and their institutions.",201.2,587

"The benefits delivered by EU funding for Scotland are significant and wide-ranging - supporting jobs,",701,591
"paying for new infrastructure across the country,",411,592
"funding research at our universities,",411,593
and providing support for our farming and fishing industries.,703.1,594
"SNP MPs will demand urgent clarity from the UK government on long-term funding arrangements after the UK leaves the EU,",408,595
and ensure that current funding levels are matched.,301,596
"Until such time as Scotland chooses to be independent, SNP MPs will support increased powers for the Scottish Parliament.",301,598
"Indeed, the implications of Brexit make it both appropriate and essential that the current devolution settlement is fundamentally revisited, to ensure that the interests of Scotland can be protected.",301,599
SNP MPs will seek additional powers.,301,600
"These will include: powers that will be repatriated from Brussels to the UK that currently sit within the competences of the Scottish Parliament, like agriculture, fisheries and environmental protection;",301,601
"powers to be repatriated in reserved areas, such as employment law, which protect fundamental rights currently enjoyed by the people of Scotland;",701,602
"new powers, beyond those being repatriated, including, but not limited to immigration;",602.2,603
"powers to conclude international agreements in areas of the Scottish Parliaments responsibility,",107,604
and powers that would allow Scotland to meet the regulatory and administrative requirements of continued European Single Market membership.,108,605
SNP MPs will support the Scottish Government to ensure that Scotlands finances are protected from any attempt by the UK government to reduce Scotlands budget.,301,607
As long as part of the Scottish Parliaments budget continues to be determined by Westminster we will fight to protect the Barnett formula.,301,608
"While handing tax cuts to the wealthiest, the Tories have cut support for the most vulnerable.",504,610
"And the Tories are now openly threatening a race to the bottom in tax, wages and working conditions.",701,611
Thats not the Scotland we seek.,504,612
"The SNP will fight to end the appalling Tory welfare policies that are punishing the most vulnerable in society  including pensioners, the disabled, vulnerable young adults, and even the bereaved.",504,613
"We will demand that the UK government calls a halt to the cuts that are damaging lives,",504,614
and we will seek new powers for the Scottish Parliament so we are better able to protect our communities.,301,615
Social security should be there for all of us in times of need.,504,617
It is part of what holds us together as a society.,606.1,618
"Social security is a safety net that we all pay into when times are good, in the expectation that it is there for us when we find ourselves in difficult financial or personal circumstance.",504,619
We will protect the principles that have underpinned the social security system since its foundations.,504,620
"The limited social security powers being devolved to the Scottish Parliament give us the opportunity to take a different approach to the Tories in Westminster, one with fairness, respect and dignity at its heart.",503,621
"However, decisions over 85 per cent of UK welfare spending in Scotland will continue to be made in Westminster.",504,622
"Only with full powers over social security will the Scottish Parliament be able to stop obscenities like the Rape Clause,",503,623
"the Family Cap,",504,624

"The SNP Scottish Government has introduced a new Child Poverty Bill, following the Tory governments decision to scrap income-based child poverty targets in the last Parliament.",504,630

and will continue to call for it to be fully devolved to Scotland.,301,662

"At the same time, the Tories have reduced the work allowance leading to a significant reduction in the support provided by Universal Credit.",504,664
This acts as a disincentive to working more hours or taking up employment.,504,665
We will support the re-instatement of the work allowance to all benefit claimants.,504,666
This will encourage people back into work by reducing the amount the state claws back  making work pay more.,504,667

"Thats why the Scottish Government needs legislative powers to control the growth and impact of these machines,",403,783

SNP MPs will press for more Scottish SMEs in Scotland to benefit from the manufacturing supply chain for major defence projects.,402,924
SNP MPs have led the calls for resolution of the destructive conflict in South Yemen.,106,926
"Given the clear evidence that munitions supplied by the United Kingdom have been used in breach of international law, there should be an immediate ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia pending proper investigation.",105,927
And we will urge the UK government to immediately halt all military support and arms sales to regimes suspected of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.,105,928
"Building on the experience of the Scottish Governments partnership with the United Nations to empower the women of Syria and promote Scotland as a centre for training of female peacemakers, the SNP will continue to support UN Security Council Resolution 1325 reaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts.",106,930
Use of banned weapons against civilian populations should be investigated by the United Nations.,201.2,931
"If the Security Council is unable to act, we believe the General Assembly should take the initiative and if the evidence supports it those responsible  including state actors  should be brought before the International Criminal Court.",107,932
SNP MPs will continue to argue that the struggle against Daesh must be pursued by more than military means and must include the battle of ideas which demonstrate that international justice and civic tolerance can be achieved without recourse to violence and barbarity.,106,933
"SNP MPs will urge the UK government to redouble its efforts to bring about a political resolution, through the UN Security Council in accordance with its Resolution 2254, to end the six year conflict in Syria.",106,934
The SNP will uphold the international agreement which led to the end of the Republic of Irans nuclear weapons programme.,106,935
Any attempt to renege on the agreement in terms of the reintegration of Iran into the international community and the relaxation of sanctions would be to undo one of the greatest achievements in peace building of recent years.,106,936
"The SNP will continue to work with international partners to progress a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East, pursuing a two state solution for Israel and Palestine.",106,937
Renewable energy is a Scottish success story.,501,939
We are determined to build on that success.,501,940
"We will fight climate change,",501,941
while keeping energy bills down,412,942
"and creating jobs,",701,943
by continuing to champion low cost renewable energy.,501,944
"Scotland has a wealth of onshore and offshore renewable energy potential which, if unlocked, can support thousands more jobs",701,946
and further economic growth.,410,947
"However, this has been undermined by the UK governments ideologically-driven cuts to support for renewables.",501,948
SNP MPs will work to ensure low cost green energy schemes get the long term certainty needed to support further development and reductions in cost.,501,949
"SNP MPs will press the Westminster government to include onshore wind, the lowest cost renewable energy technology, in its industrial strategy.",501,950
"They will also demand an increased focus on offshore wind, tidal energy and wave power.",501,951
Our MPs will support the development of wind and other renewable energy projects in the Northern and Western Isles  and a clear timescale for the delivery of the electricity interconnectors needed in the islands.,501,952
The SNP will champion the interests of island and mainland communities to ensure they benefit financially from renewable energy projects and Scotlands outstanding natural resources.,416.2,953
SNP MPs will work to protect Scotlands place in Europes energy markets and funding programmes  ensuring continued funding and cooperation with the EU for Scotlands renewable energy sector.,411,954
"The European Union is set to establish a 320 million investment fund to support wave and tidal power, in which Scotland is a world leader.",411,955
"We will also seek to build a regulatory environment which supports investment in new energy storage schemes, including pumped hydro and batteries, allowing Scotland to maximise the benefits of our outstanding resources",416.2,956
and build an energy system for the 21st century.,411,957
"We want Scotland to be a leader in the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology,",601.1,959
"which has the potential to create thousands of jobs in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and beyond,",701,960
while fighting climate change.,501,961
Scotlands oil and gas sector remains uniquely well placed to develop CCS on an industrial scale  despite the UK government reneging on its commitment to a £1 billion project set to benefit Peterhead Power Station.,411,962
We will work to ensure Scotland is not denied this opportunity by working to secure the funding needed to develop this vital technology here in Scotland.,411,963
"The UKs punitive transmission charging regime forces renewable and conventional energy generators in Scotland to pay huge fees to connect to the electricity grid, while power stations in the south of England receive subsidies.",301,965
"This unfair system contributed to the early closure of the power stations at Longannet in Fife and Cockenzie in East Lothian, with the loss of hundreds of local jobs, and must be overhauled.",701,966
"The SNP will continue to demand the reform of the punitive transmission charging regime, which has come to symbolise the UK governments repeated failure to deliver energy policies which meet Scotlands needs.",301,967
"The UK government is determined to push ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in the south of England, which will cost at least £18 billion to build and will result in huge costs for taxpayers and consumers.",303,969
"We are opposed to these plans, which have already come close to collapse.",303,970
"If built, electricity generated by Hinkley C will be sold for more than twice the current retail price.",303,971
SNP MPs will hold the UK government to account over its support for the Hinkley white elephant.,303,972
Scotland has already exceeded a world-leading target to reduce emissions by 42 per cent by 2020.,501,974
"The Scottish Government has now produced a draft Climate Change Plan, with tougher targets for future years, ensuring Scotland continues to set an example for other countries to follow.",501,975
SNP MPs will press the UK government to match Scotlands commitment and ambition.,501,976
SNP MPs will work to prevent the threat of Brexit being used by the UK to reduce commitments to tackle climate change or to undermine the European Unions efforts to fight climate change and protect the environment.,501,977
"Scotland has played an important role in these areas, and has also directly benefited from the EUs work.",501,978
"We are determined to safeguard the advances which have already been made, while continuing to protect and enhance our environment in the years ahead.",501,979
We will defend the interests of environmental scientists from across the EU who contribute so much to the success of Scotlands research institutes.,411,980
We will oppose any relaxation of the laws on fox-hunting.,501,982
"Extreme poverty,",504,993
"inequality,",503,994
"climate change,",501,995
"the plight of refugees fleeing war and repression,",201.2,996
and the humanitarian impact of disasters and emergencies are global issues on which we have a moral duty to act.,107,997
"A strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster will make sure that when it comes to their humanitarian and moral obligations, the UK government will not be let off the hook.",201.2,998
SNP MPs will hold the UK government to its commitment of spending 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income on international development.,107,1000
We will seek to ensure overseas aid funding meets the internationally-recognised Development Assistance Criteria and does not undermine public services in developing countries.,107,1001
We believe that overseas aid funding must not be used for defence or intelligence related expenditure.,201.2,1002
We will urge the UK government to ensure development programmes have human rights and the rights of women at their heart.,201.2,1003
"The worlds poorest and most vulnerable countries are the least responsible for climate change, yet face its biggest impacts.",201.2,1004
"We will maintain the position of a Climate Justice Spokesperson, and call on the UK government to match the approach of the Scottish Government with a dedicated Climate Justice Fund.",201.2,1005
"In 2015, Scotlands First Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government would be one of the first anywhere in the world to commit to meeting the UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development, both at home and overseas.",305.1,1006
"The Global Goals should be a key focus for international development policy and spending,",107,1007
and the particular role of women and girls in development must be recognised.,706,1008
The Department for International Development should be maintained as a stand-alone department of Government with its own Secretary of State.,107,1009
"SNP MPs will continue to support the EU in the pursuit of the objectives outlined in the EU Global Strategy, particularly in the cross-cutting themes of Human Rights,",201.2,1010
"Women,",706,1011
Peace and Security,106,1012
and Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment.,503,1013
"As new trading relationships are formed, the SNP will back policies which support development and ensure that the UKs trade arrangements with developing countries prioritise poverty reduction.",416.2,1014
"Given Scotlands long and enduring relationship with Malawi, the SNP will continue to call for the UK government to renegotiate a new, fair tax treaty with Malawi.",107,1015
"As the UK sets its own trade policy, it must be done responsibly and ethically.",416.2,1017
ActionAid has ranked the UK joint worst in the world for having the largest number of treaties with developing countries which most restrict the rights of poor countries to tax UK companies operating there.,416.2,1018
The SNP will urge the UK government to develop a trade and development policy that outlines how the UK will support development as part of its trade with developing countries.,107,1019
"The SNP Scottish Government has committed to always consider the human rights implications of its engagement with countries and business and to ensure that investment agreements should only be signed where appropriate due diligence, including on the human rights record of companies involved, has been undertaken.",201.2,1020
The SNP Scottish Government is now engaging with Amnesty International to put these commitments into practice.,201.2,1021
SNP MPs will demand that the UK government follows the lead of the Scottish Government.,201.2,1022
"SNP MPs will support the establishment of a special envoy to promote the rights of LGBTI people throughout the world, as an integral part of UK foreign policy - helping to alleviate the discrimination and persecution faced by LGBTI people in Chechnya and across the world.",503,1024
"We believe that the UK government has a responsibility  through action and leadership  to tackle global issues such as extreme poverty,",107,1026
"the impact of climate change,",501,1027
the plight of refugees fleeing war and repression,201.2,1028
and the humanitarian impact of disasters and emergencies.,107,1029
The UK governments response to the refugee and migration crisis has fallen far short of their humanitarian and moral duty.,201.2,1030
The decision to close the Dubs Scheme for unaccompanied children  putting them at risk of exploitation  is shameful.,201.2,1031
SNP MPs will back an immediate reversal to ensure safe and legal routes are open.,201.2,1032
"In addition, the Dublin Regulation process needs to be simplified, reformed, and properly implemented so that those with family in the UK can be more easily reunited with them.",201.2,1033
"SNP MPs will urge the UK government to take action on the recommendations of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees including implementing a National Refugee Integration Strategy that ensures all agencies coordinate support for refugees and helps refugees take part in, and contribute to, our society.",201.2,1034
There has been a worrying trend in the rhetoric coming from the current UK government as it relates to those seeking protection.,201.2,1035
The SNP will always defend the system of international protection of refugees that provides a place of safety for those facing serious harm or persecution.,201.2,1036
We need to ensure that the system of assessing asylum claims is thorough and fair and treats all passing through it with dignity.,201.2,1037
Those who have waited six months for an asylum decision should be able to use their skills and to support themselves by taking up work  as most EU countries allow.,201.2,1038
We will continue to oppose the continued cuts to support that have led to asylum seekers becoming destitute.,201.2,1039
We need to fundamentally change the UK governments system for housing asylum seekers.,201.2,1040
The disgraceful condition of the housing provided and the contracts the UK government has with providers have been roundly criticised by all parties.,201.2,1041
The Scottish Governments work to resettle Syrian refugees has shown how people can be supported and welcomed into communities and should be used as basis for settling asylum seekers in the future.,201.2,1042
"We will urge the UK government to work with the devolved administrations, local authorities and local communities to provide services for asylum seekers",301,1043
rather than use private contractors who have profit rather than people as their prime motive.,413,1044
"There needs to be reform to the detention and asylum system for LGBTI individuals escaping countries where homosexuality is still criminalised, removing unfair and invasive demands for proof of sexuality or gender identity.",201.2,1045
To deliver our plan we need a strong team of DUP MPs returned to Westminster to negotiate a good deal for Northern Ireland in the event of a hung parliament.,601,9
Only a vote for the DUP will deliver our clear plan for a better Northern Ireland and a stronger United Kingdom.,601,10
We want to create a shared and united Northern Ireland,606,11
that is economically prosperous,410,12
and plays a full and active role as part of the United Kingdom.,601,13
We will use our position at Westminster to strengthen the UK,601,14
and to seek the best deal for Northern Ireland.,601,15
We will fight for the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland.,601,16
Since devolution was restored to Northern Ireland in 2007 real progress has been made across a range of areas.,301,17
"Despite all of the political ups and downs, Northern Ireland is slowly but surely moving in the right direction again.",601,18
"Over these last eight years we have been working to secure Northern Irelands position within the UK,",601,19
"to help grow our economy,",410,20
to offer opportunity to all,503,21
and to build reconciliation and address the legacy of the past.,106,22
"This challenge has been made all the more difficult by virtue of the global economic downturn,",410,23
the reduction in public expenditure available to the Northern Ireland Executive,602,24
and the system of government we operate.,602,25
"In spite of this, things are changing for the better.",601,26
The transformation is visible wherever you look.,601,27
"Northern Ireland is now a venue not just for international investment, but for events that would not have considered coming here just a few years ago.",601,28
"We have a plan for where we want Northern Ireland to be in 2021, the hundredth anniversary of Northern Irelands creation.",601,29
We have been working to deliver it.,601,30
"However, the election on 7 May will give Northern Ireland the opportunity of a lifetime to transform our Province for generations.",601,31
It is highly likely that after that election no single party will have enough seats to command a majority in the House of Commons.,305,32
That means that the votes of our MPs could be crucial.,305,33
Political commentators have consistently stated that the DUP could be crucial in what looks likely to be a hung Parliament.,305,34
The DUP will use such a position to negotiate on behalf of Northern Ireland.,305,35
This document sets out some of our key priorities for discussion with the parties which could form the next government.,305,36
It also sets out what we will do to create the kind of Northern Ireland we all wish to see.,305,37
"A century ago Ulster was an economic powerhouse within the British Isles: today with the right investment, policies and dedication we have the potential to create the conditions where we can be so once again.",410,38
To do so we need help from Westminster and we need to take bold steps at home as well.,410,39
The influence that we may have after this election gives us the once in a lifetime opportunity to transform our economic fortunes for generations to come.,410,40
In doing so we are building on firm foundations that have been laid over the last few years.,410,41
In 2007 we made growing our economy the Executives number one priority.,410,42
The restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland has created the peace and political stability to encourage foreign direct investment at record levels.,410,43
In fact despite the worldwide economic downturn more jobs have been created in Northern Ireland over the last four years than at any time in recorded history.,410,44
Global businesses establishing in Northern Ireland are now the norm rather than the exception.,410,45
Our claimant count has been falling for over 25 months and our headline rate of unemployment is broadly in line with the UK average.,410,46
"For the first time in many years Northern Ireland is emerging from an economic downturn alongside, rather than after the rest of the UK.",410,47
After years of campaigning we managed to persuade the UK Government to allow the Assembly to set a Northern Ireland Corporation Tax Rate,402,48
and previously had secured the devolution of Air Passenger Duty for longhaul flights.,402,49
We have attracted international events to Northern Ireland from the Giro dItalia to the Irish Open Golf and from the European MTV Awards to the World Police and Fire Games.,410,50
We have invested in our tourism infrastructure with signature projects such as Titanic Belfast,410,51
and the Giants Causeway Visitor Centre,410,52
"and of course Northern Ireland is now known worldwide as the home of the hit HBO television series, Game of Thrones.",410,53
With the right support we can build upon the important work that has been done in recent years to make sure that Northern Ireland once again plays its part as an economic driver,410,54
within the United Kingdom.,601,55
More satisfactory terms in relation to Corporation Tax;,402,57
The national debt and deficit addressed in a way which secures economic growth and longterm prosperity,410,60
while protecting essential public services;,504,61
UK wide tax policy improvements to encourage economic growth in Northern Ireland;,402,62

Take the decisions to make sure our people can take advantage of new economic opportunities;,403,82
Remove the barriers to economic growth;,401,83
Reform our planning system;,403,84
Build more economic and transport infrastructure for the future;,411,85
Continue to invest in our tourism infrastructure;,410,86
Bring international events to Northern Ireland;,410,87
Put Northern Ireland on the map internationally and attract visitors from abroad.,410,88
One of the most important duties of any government is to deliver high quality public services.,504,89
This task is challenging given the increasing expectations and increased demand and the reduction in public expenditure available to Northern Ireland.,504,90
"However, despite the difficulties we have sought to meet the needs of our people by prioritising our key public services,",504,91
saving money by cutting waste,303,92
and by reforming the services that we deliver.,303,93
With the reduction in public expenditure over recent years we have had to prioritise what we need most and focus on what matters most to our people.,303,94
"In spite of the £1.5 billion reduction, in real terms, in the funding we receive in Northern Ireland, over the last eight years we have made health",504,95
and education our top two priorities in terms of public expenditure.,506,96
As a result we have increases in spending on health by 33%,504,97
and education by 23% since 2007.,506,98
That has allowed us to make sure we spend the money available to us on the areas that matter most to the general public.,303,99
As part of this process we have set ambitious targets in terms of achieving savings across government departments.,303,100
As a result in the last two Assembly terms savings of over £4 billion have been achieved to free up money from important frontline services.,303,101
Those savings have been critical to ensuring we continue to deliver the best quality public services.,503,102
"Since the restoration of devolution we have also invested more in capital spending in areas such as schools, hospitals and roads than at any point in our history.",503,103
"That has meant more new schools, hospitals and roads and other key capital infrastructure.",503,104
"The Northern Ireland Executive has also undertaken a significant programme of public sector reform with major changes in education administration, the health service and in local government.",303,105
These decisions will allow more resources to be targeted on front line services and less on administration in future years.,303,106
We have played our part in making the best use of the resources that are available to us,303,107
but it is always the dedication and commitment of those who work in the public sector that ensures world class public services can be delivered.,701,108
The challenges of delivering world class public services will only increase in the years to come but with support from Westminster and the right decisions taken at home we can not only meet but exceed expectations of our people.,601,109
A budget settlement which will allow real term increases in health,504,111
and education spending over the next five years,506,112
without decimating other key public services;,503,113
Capital investment to make our schools and hospitals fit for the twenty first century;,411,114
Assistance to reform and transform our public services.,303,115

and growing the economy;,410,118
Set ambitious targets to cut wasteful spending;,303,119
Reform the delivery of public services to ensure that they meet the needs and expectations of the public;,303,120

Expand the scope and scale of Northern Ireland's government shared services system;,303,124
Develop a comprehensive Civil Service Reform Plan with the aim of achieving a public sector fit for the challenges of the 21st Century;,303,125
Continue to construct a public sector reform architecture that enables the Northern Ireland Executive to adopt innovative solutions to public service challenges.,303,126
One of our key goals has been to ensure that everyone can benefit from the new era that Northern Ireland has now entered and no one is left behind.,503,127
That means there must be the opportunity for everyone to succeed and a fair and level playing field for all.,503,128
This approach will not only create a society based on fairness but it will maximise the interests of Northern Ireland as a whole.,503,129
We have been working to achieve the twin goals of fairness and opportunity for all in recent years through a range of measures.,503,130
Through the Stormont House Agreement we sought to deliver affordable changes to the welfare system that would protect the most vulnerable,503,131
but would also encourage people back to work.,505,132
That includes ensuring that the bedroom tax is not in operation in Northern Ireland.,503,133
In dealing with the issue of welfare reform it is vital that we keep the proper balance between enhancing the GB welfare system and the protection of frontline public services.,414,134
We have sought to keep higher education open to all by keeping student fees much lower than in England.,506,135
Through the Social Investment Fund we have worked with communities to deliver programmes tailored to meet their specific needs.,503,136
Through Delivering Social Change we have invested in measures such as additional support for children to deliver good GCSE results.,506,137
We are working on a revolutionary new Childcare system that could help transform the sector.,504,138
We have extended support for older people including through the free transport scheme.,504,139
"To encourage opportunity for all, in education we have also retained selection based on academic ability and not the ability to pay.",503,140
"In the departments for which we have responsibility we are doing everything within the law to ensure that our Armed Forces, veterans and dependants have every possible support.",104,141
We have also ensured that local household taxes in Northern Ireland are significantly lower than anywhere else in the UK,403,142
and have resisted the introduction of Water Charges.,503,143
While we have achieved much in this area we will need the help and support of Westminster to deliver on some of our key outstanding objectives.,302,144
Welfare Reform to incentivise work but also protect those most in need;,503,146
"FROM  WESTMINSTER,  WE  WANT: The removal of the bedroom tax at a national level;",504,147
A national entitlement to enhanced support for members of the Armed Forces across the United Kingdom;,503,148
"Victims and Members of the Armed Forces, serving and retired to be given protected status, akin to the protection for groups under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act;",503,149
To ensure economic migrants must have contributed to the UK before they are entitled to claim benefits;,505,151
Proper border controls and a tougher immigration policy;,403,152
A UK wide charter for animal protection.,501,153

Create an education system that guarantees a fair start and opportunity for every child;,506,157
Make Higher Education affordable for all;,506,158

Help families by keeping household taxes the lowest in the United Kingdom;,503,161
Be tough on crime;,605,162
Support tougher sentences for those who attack older people and vulnerable people.,605,163
"For the first time in generations, despite all of the challenges and difficulties, Northern Ireland has had almost eight years of uninterrupted devolution.",301,164
Given the history of the last fifty years this is in itself a remarkable achievement.,301,165
During this time we have overcome many problems and have put in place arrangements that have been robust and stable.,301,166
"We do not seek to do anything which will threaten the long term stability of the political institutions however, we must now make sure that it works better in delivering for the people we represent.",202,167
In seeking to create a better system of government we should remember the progress that we have made.,202,168
The St Andrews Agreement corrected some of the key flaws of the Belfast Agreement but we continue to work towards more normal politics in Northern Ireland.,202,169
As a result of these changes important decisions require Executive approval and we have a veto over all big issues.,301,170
After years of debate and dispute we negotiated appropriate arrangements which allowed Policing and Justice powers to be passed to the Assembly in 2010 on a basis which requires the Justice Minister to be able to command a cross community majority and have operated well since,301,171
For many years we have campaigned for changes to how devolution operates.,204,173
Some of these objectives were delivered as part of the talks process which concluded last Christmas.,204,174
The Stormont House Agreement made provision for a reduction in the number of MLAs which will take effect no later than 2021.,303,175
It also agreed to create arrangements for an official opposition at Stormont and better processes for the Executive.,303,176
We have agreed a reduction in the number of government departments from twelve to nine and a reordering of functions to improve the delivery of public services.,303,177
"This will also mean a fundamental change and to OFMDFM and a more strategic focus with a new name, The Executive Office.",303,178
For us to deliver the kind of changes and improvements we want to see we will need the support of Westminster to make sure that politics operates better in Northern Ireland.,302,179
Support to strengthen the political process in Northern Ireland;,602,181
Constitutional stability for Northern Ireland;,204,182

Support for Northern Irelands constitutional position within the United Kingdom has never been higher.,203,200
The number of people who want to see a united Ireland in either the short or the medium term is at an all time low.,203,201
The constitutional future of Northern Ireland has been settled for generations to come.,203,202
This has been achieved by agreeing political structures in Northern Ireland that can command crosscommunity support,202,203
and by ensuring everyone can play a full part in our society and community.,202,204
"While we should never be complacent about what has been achieved,",601,205
the focus must now move to strengthen the United Kingdom as a whole,601,206
and to enhance our British identity in Northern Ireland.,601,207
"Our place as a key and integral part of the United Kingdom has been highlighted in recent years by the decision to host the G8 at Lough Erne,",601,208
the visit of Her Majesty to Stormont in 2012,601,209
and the enormous role our people continue to play in the Armed Services.,601,210
Northern Ireland plays its full part alongside Scotland and Wales in intergovernmental relations within the United Kingdom,601,211
and every aspect of our government remains linked to Westminster.,601,212
Despite the opposition of Sinn Fein the work of the National Crime Agency is also being extended to Northern Ireland.,601,213
At Westminster our MPs have been at the forefront of the campaign for a referendum on the European Union,110,214
and in defence of our Armed Forces.,104,215
"They continue to play a key and critical role in the decisions, which affect our nation as a whole.",601,216
We have built strong and solid relationships with both major Westminster parties to allow us to maximise our influence whatever the outcome of the general election.,601,217
In Northern Ireland we are working with other unionist parties to maximise unionist representation at Westminster and to deliver on the many areas of policy where we can find agreement.,601,218
"While there is much we can do in Northern Ireland, some of these issues can only be delivered with the help of Westminster.",601,219

Campaign to highlight the benefits of the Union to Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland to the Union.,601,245
The Democratic Unionist Party believes that Northern Ireland needs a working Assembly and Executive as the best form of government for all of our people.,301,2
Stormont is far from perfect but it is immeasurably better than what happened before or what would replace it.,301,3
The progress we have made should not be easily cast aside to be replaced by uncertainty with power transferred to unaccountable Direct Rule Ministers.,301,4
There are 5 pressing reasons why we need devolution restored immediately.,301,5
To help achieve the best deal for Northern Ireland as the UK leaves the EU,110,6
 at precisely the time when Northern Irelands voice needs to be heard loudly and clearly the Northern Ireland Executive has not been formed.,301,7
If we are to deal with the challenges and seize the opportunities that leaving the European Union presents then we need our own local Ministers lobbying London and Brussels.,110,8
To get a Budget put in place ,303,9
Northern Ireland is in unchartered territory where senior Civil Servants are making public spending decisions and not elected politicians.,303,10
Sinn Feins Finance Minister left post without proposing a Budget.,305.1,11
"Key public services and  most importantly  the people who rely on them, need a Budget to be set so they can get the support they need.",303,12
To progress much needed health reforms ,504,13
our National Health Service faces unprecedented pressures.,504,14
The DUP kick started much needed reforms aimed at creating a new model of health and social care,504,15
and reducing bureaucracy and streamlining structures.,303,16
Those reforms are now effectively on hold with challenges like waiting lists mounting.,504,17
People should not have to wait any longer to have those reforms implemented and problems tackled.,504,18
To protect and improve our education system ,506,19
the impact of not having an Executive in place is already being felt across our school system.,506,20
Having an Executive up and running is critical to resolving the funding crisis facing our schools thus ensuring that we prioritise frontline funding for our schools so that all our children receive the best educational start in life.,506,21
It is vital that we build on positive practical reforms in education.,506,22
To attract investment and jobs ,701,23
it is no coincidence that our record levels of inward investment have happened during a sustained period of devolution.,301,24
Having stable structures at Stormont with local Ministers leading efforts to sell Northern Ireland internationally has helped us secure thousands of new jobs.,701,25
"Without devolution, all of the efforts to reduce our rate of Corporation tax will have been for nothing.",301,26
Political stability is key to our future economic success.,305.3,27
"Immediately after the General Election, we will enter another round of negotiations.",305.3,29
The DUP will place the interests of the people of Northern Ireland first in those negotiations.,305.3,30
We will not draw any red lines or put any roadblocks in the way of seeing an Executive formed straight away.,305.3,31
It is absolutely imperative that voters use this election to not only send a clear message that they want to see Stormont restored,301,32
but also give unionism the strongest possible hand in the talks.,601.1,33
"No other Party has the strength, unity or experience of delivering for unionism that the DUP possesses.",305.1,34
"Unionists remember what it was like in the past when Sinn Fein were able to advance their radical republican agenda in negotiations, aided and abetted by weak unionists.",305.1,35
This all changed when the DUP started to lead unionism.,305.1,36
"Since 2003, the DUP has slowly but surely regained ground for unionism culminating in the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.",305.1,37
"Sinn Fein have sought to use their mandate at the last Assembly election to block the re-establishment of the Assembly,",305.1,38
to demand a destabilising Border Poll,305.1,39
and to push their agenda.,305.1,40
Its time for unionists to come out and vote so the real voice of Northern Ireland is heard.,601.1,41
The DUP needs a strong mandate to stand strong against Sinn Feins demands.,305.1,42
Immediately after the election on 8 June the negotiations aimed at restoring devolution will recommence with a view to establishing a new Executive by 29 June.,301,43
We will enter these negotiations with a positive approach and a goal of seeing the Assembly and Executive restored.,301,44
We will not draw any red lines or preconditions but will judge any potential deal against 5 core tests.^,301,45
Is the agreement likely to increase support for Northern Irelands constitutional position within the United Kingdom?,301,46
Is the agreement fully consistent with Northern Ireland remaining a full and integral part of the United Kingdom?,601.1,47
Is the agreement fully compatible with our British citizenship?,601.1,48
Will the agreement result in better government and policies for the people of Northern Ireland than a return to Direct Rule?,301,49
Is the agreement consistent with the mandate we received for our Assembly manifesto in March?,202.1,50
For ease of reference we set out the 10 commitments for negotiations which were endorsed on 2 March.,301,51
We will work to avoid Direct Rule and get local government back at Stormont as quickly as possible.,301,53
Our demands in negotiations will be proportionate to those of Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein.,202.1,54
"As has been the case since 2007, we remain committed to working constructively and in partnership with all those who are in an Executive after an election.",202.1,55
"We will respond positively to any proposals to increase transparency, accountability",202.1,56
and will help the institutions function more effectively.,202.1,57
We will not compromise on fundamental unionist principles in order to retain power.,601.1,58
We will not permit the rewriting of the past,601.1,59
or the persecution of the security forces.,605.1,60
We will oppose any Border Poll outside the terms of the Belfast Agreement.,601.1,61
We will stand over those proposals for reform as set out in our Making Stormont Work Better document which have not yet been delivered.,305.1,62
We will work to ensure the full implementation of the Military Covenant in Northern Ireland.,104,63
We will honour all previous commitments we have made on the basis that republicans will honour theirs as well.,202.1,64
Our national and local economy has been improving steadily over the last number of years.,410,66
"Indeed, Northern Ireland is performing better in some aspects than the rest of the UK.",410,67
"The DUP believes that it is essential that the benefits of economic growth are felt by everyone, everywhere.",503,68
An improving economy must not just be for the benefit of big companies or confined to London and the South East.,503,69
Growth must also have a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of hardworking families in every part of our nation.,503,70
We welcome the fact that median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees increased by 2.2% in Northern Ireland last year.,701,71
That made it the second consecutive annual increase in inflation adjusted earnings in the region.,701,72
We want to see continued improvement in earnings and incomes.,701,73
We understand that it will be the responsibility of the Party that forms the next Government to bring forward a Budget that encourages economic growth,410,74
and protects our societys most vulnerable.,503,75
The DUP proposes measures aimed at increasing family incomes that we seek to have included in future Budgets.,701,76
The newly introduced National Living Wage (NLW) has helped increase family incomes across the United Kingdom.,412,78
"Whilst acknowledging the pressures that the NLW can place upon small businesses, the DUP believes that it can have a positive impact on working families, help lift people out of poverty and make work pay.",412,79
The DUP supports:Continued increases in the National Living Wage; and,412,80
Firm action against companies who fail to pay their staff the NLW.,605.1,81
The DUP were frontrunners in proposing increases in the personal tax allowance.,504,83
"We firmly believe that the gradual increase in the personal tax allowance has been positive for all taxpayers but especially for the lowest paid, taking them out of the tax system entirely, and hugely beneficial for thousands of people from Northern Ireland.",504,84
"In Parliament, we will support proposals to further increase the personal allowance.",504,85
The TV licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communication that no longer exists.,303,87
The success of Netflix and Amazon streaming services shows that subscription based media can and does work.,401,88
An independent Commission should be established to conduct a review of how the BBC is structured and the services it provides,303,89
"and to examine alternative funding models,",401,90
identify the opportunities for competitive tendering of key services,401,91
and produce a plan that will either significantly reduce the licence fee or abolish it.,401,92
The DUP has always advocated for the interests of our older people.,706,94
"In the Northern Ireland Executive, we have introduced initiatives like free bus passes and have defended their retention against those who would take them away.",504,95
We will continue our staunch support for pensioners in the new Parliament.,504,96
The DUP will:Support the maintenance of the pensions triple lock; and,504,97
Support an end to the unfair treatment of women pensioners.,503,98
"Paying for oil, gas and electricity can consume a significant chunk of household budgets.",412,100
A perception exists that electricity prices in Northern Ireland are high.,412,101
"Whilst prices are undoubtedly high for the largest industrial customers, our approximately 800,000 domestic customers pay just below the EU average for their electricity and considerably lower than their counterparts in the Republic of Ireland.",412,102
The DUP wants to see our energy companies place further downward pressure on household bills.,412,103
We will support efforts to better control energy bills and will seek to ensure any such measure operates in Northern Ireland.,412,104
The DUP is proud of the universal benefits we have introduced in Northern Ireland like free public transport for the over 60s.,504,106
Some parties have once again placed universal benefits like the winter fuel allowance in their sights.,504,107
The DUP will resist any assault on these important universal benefits.,504,108
Northern Irelands economy  like the rest of the United Kingdoms  is heading in the right direction.,410,110
Key economic indicators show sustained progress across a range of important areas:,410,111
Our unemployment rate and economic inactivity levels have fallen significantly since their peak during the downturn;,701,112
Growth of 1.6% in the last year driven by the private sector;,410,113
Spending on Research & Development rose by 24% last year to £750 million  an all time high;,411,114
Exports by Northern Ireland companies increased by 6% in the past year  the highest increase of any UK region;,410,115
Manufacturing sales increased by 6% in the last year and jobs in the sector grew by 1.4%; and,410,116
External visitor numbers increased by 12% to 2.6 million.,410,117
We are determined to build on that success and continue the positive development in our economic fortunes.,410,118
This is our plan for the Northern Ireland economy.,410,119
"Northern Ireland has experienced falling unemployment,",701,121
increased job creation,701,122
and record levels of inward investment.,410,123
"Between 2011 and 2016: 42,500 new jobs were promoted",701,124
64% of those new jobs were outside of Belfast,701,125
£3 billion of employment related investment was secu red,701,126
"The DUP wants to build on that outstanding success by: Reaffirming our pledge to create 50,000 new jobs by 2021;",701,127
Implementing the Economic Inactivity Strategy; and,504,128
Reducing Northern Irelands Corporation Tax rate to at least 12.5%.,402,129
Northern Ireland has a rich industrial heritage.,601.1,131
The DUP wants to build on our strong manufacturing base and encourage a renaissance in Northern Ireland industry.,411,132
The DUP supports the delivery of an ambitious new Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland which is aimed at increasing our competitiveness,411,133
and ensuring inclusive growth.,416.2,134
A Northern Ireland Industrial Strategy must be aligned to the wider UK Industrial Strategy and be centred on: Accelerating innovation and research;,411,135
"Enhancing education, skills and employability;",506,136
"Driving inclusive, sustainable growth;",416.2,137
Succeeding in global markets; and,410,138
Building the best economic infrastructure.,411,139
While some seek to talk Northern Ireland down we see huge potential in our economy.,410,140
"Northern Ireland has world class capabilities in sectors such as cyber security, agri-foods, advanced engineering and materials handling.",411,141
"By taking a long term, ten years plus view, we can become a globally competitive economy",401,142
built upon a renewed and reinvigorated industrial base.,411,143
We will also continue to press HM Government to create City Region Growth Deals for Northern Ireland.,410,144
Increasing exports and improving trade links will play a huge part in Northern Irelands economic future.,410,146
"While Northern Ireland has been the best performing region for exports in the whole of the United Kingdom, we must build on that success and begin the groundwork needed to capitalise on the trade opportunities that the UK leaving the EU will present.",410,147
Thats why the DUP introduced an International Trade Plan which included: a new Trade Advisory Board;,407,148
the appointment of Northern Ireland Trade Ambassadors;,407,149
the expansion of Invest NIs international presence in up to 10 more locations;,407,150
"the creation of new trade, investment and innovation hubs in key global markets; and",407,151
a Trade Accelerator Plan including an enhanced range of initiatives to help support both new and existing exporters to explore new markets,407,152
The DUP supports the roll out of the International Trade Plan,407,153
"and we will ensure that the new Department of International Trade works closely with Invest NI to, for example, include more local companies in UK wide trade missions to help them develop international business opportunities.",407,154
We will lobby Her Majestys Government to: help market Northern Ireland internationally through its agencies and embassies across the world;,407,155
establish a Freeports policy targeted at economically underdeveloped parts of the UK,407,156
encourage international events to be staged in Northern Ireland; and,407,157
continue to incorporate Northern Ireland prominently in UK branding.,407,158
Northern Ireland has developed hugely in recent times as a must visit destination for visitors from around the world.,408,160
The DUP supports the development of a new Tourism Strategy for Northern Ireland to take the industry here to a new level and reach our full potential.,410,161
A Tourism Strategy should: Introduce a Capital Investment Fund for the development of new tourism products;,402,162
Create a Tourism Development Fund to support the growth of tourism businesses with an export potential;,402,163
Establish a Market Access Fund to encourage businesses to participate in marketing activity;,402,164
"Set a target of 3,000 new hotel beds; and",404,165
Establish a new Air Routes Task Force.,411,166
We will also pursue: The abolition of Air Passenger Duty; and,402,167
A cut in the VAT rate for tourism businesses.,402,168
Northern Ireland needs a secure and sustainable energy supply for both domestic and business customers.,416.2,170
"While concerns have been highlighted about the future security of supply of electricity in Northern Ireland, the DUP believes that this can be addressed by continued progress on interconnection, market integration and the development of new generation capacity.",411,171
We are encouraged by recent planning applications for new power stations and see this as a sign that the market is responding positively and that the issues with security of supply can be addressed.,411,172
The DUP also believes that a comprehensive new Energy Strategy is needed to deal with security of supply as well as the future of renewable energy policy in Northern Ireland.,411,173
The DUP supports:  A comprehensive new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland;,411,174
Continued progress on the Integrated Single Electricity Market and the North South Interconnector;,411,175
Improved interconnection with Great Britain; and,411,176
The development of new generation capacity.,411,177
Northern Ireland is already a great place to do business.,410,179
"Whether it is a start-up or an inward investor, Northern Ireland offers companies a lower cost base, loyal and skilled workers and sensible regulation.",402,180
The DUP wants to build on that hard-earned reputation and make Northern Ireland not just a good place but the best place to do business.,410,181
We will support:  Keeping the cost of doing business low by maintaining Industrial De-Rating and the Small Business Rates Relief;,402,182
Reducing the rate of Corporation Tax to at least 12.5%;,402,183
Introducing a new Better Business Initiative that will systematically review health and safety legislation working in concert with sectors such as construction;,416.2,184
the maintenance of the present workers rights framework and for the UK to lead the way in improving this framework as it has throughout its history;,701,185
UK wide tax policy improvements to encourage economic growth in Northern Ireland; and,402,186
Assistance from HM Government to attract FDI into Northern Ireland.,410,187
A strong skills base has been a substantial element to Northern Irelands recent economic success.,411,189
"In an increasingly competitive global economy, it is often the skills and talents of our people that positively differentiate Northern Ireland from other possible investment destinations.",411,190
Investment in skills must continue if Northern Ireland is to continue to secure jobs and investment.,411,191
The DUP supports: Further investment in job focused skills schemes like Assured Skills and Future Skills to provide potential investors and existing employers with the skilled workers they need to grow;,411,192
"A digital skills revolution in our schools, colleges and universities to enable young people to become digital citizens, digital workers and digital makers, ready for the modern economy;",411,193
Continued delivery of the reformed apprenticeships and youth training systems;,411,194
Efforts to deliver a better deal for NI business from the Apprenticeship Levy;,411,195
Increased involvement of industry in shaping the skills agenda; and,411,196
Better alignment of third level courses with the strong and emerging sectors of our economy.,411,197
Investment in infrastructure is crucial for economic competitiveness as well as providing a boost for the local construction industry.,411,199
"Given Northern Irelands geographical location, improved digital and transport connectivity remain key to building a world class economy.",411,200
The DUP will:  Support expansion at Heathrow as the UKs aviation hub with increased air connectivity to Northern Ireland;,411,201
Seek an independent investigation into ferry price structures on North Channel and Irish Sea routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain;,411,202
Develop a comprehensive Broadband Infrastructure Plan to roll out high speed internet connectivity across Northern Ireland;,411,203
Continue to press the mobile telephony providers to invest in their networks ensuring 4G provision across Northern Ireland and that we are at the forefront of future 5G investments; and,411,204
Establish the new Northern Ireland Infrastructure Fund as quickly as possible.,411,205
The DUP has a track record of positively reforming public services and streamlining the political system.,303,207
"Due to our determination, we have delivered: a reduction in the number of Government Departments from 12 to 9;",303,208
a reduction in the number of Special Advisors;,303,209
a reduction in the number of MLAs per constituency from 6 to 5; and,303,210
a reduction in the number of Councils from 26 to 11.,303,211
The DUP has also been the driving force behind a series of public sector reforms which are aimed at developing a more effective and more efficient government.,303,212
These include: a Civil Service Voluntary Exit Scheme yielding annual savings of approximately £100 million;,303,213
a Public Sector Reform Architecture including the NI Public Sector Innovation Laboratory; and,303,214
"a suite of internationally renowned Shared Services which have saved the public purse hundreds of millions of pounds in reduced office, IT, procurement and energy costs.",303,215
Reforming public services is not solely about realising efficiencies so that Northern Ireland can live within its means.,303,216
"It is also about delivering a more effective public sector and freeing up resources to be spent on priorities like schools, hospitals and policing.",303,217
The DUP wants to continue to reform our public sector.,303,218
This is our Plan to improve public services in Northern Ireland.,303,219
"The DUP believes that all parties should agree to the creation of a structured, long term, cross-government National Reform Plan for Northern Ireland including measurable targets and agreed implementation dates.",303,221
Elements of a National Reform Plan for Northern Ireland could include: alternative models of service delivery such as increasing the use of social enterprises;,505,222
a Civil Service Reform Plan;,303,223
a more digital government;,303,224
expanding shared services provision; and,303,225
a dedicated Change Fund to stimulate reform.,303,226
The DUP will fight hard at Westminster for a Budget settlement that allows for real terms increases in health and education spending over the next parliamentary term and will prioritise these areas in future Northern Ireland Budgets.,504,228
"The DUP were in the driving seat in developing ambitious, far sighted reforms for our National Health Service in Northern Ireland.",303,230
"These reforms including the Bengoa Panels recommendations for a new model of health and social care, and proposals to eliminate a layer of bureaucracy by abolishing the HSC Board are much needed.",303,231
The DUP supports these reforms and wants to see them progressed as a matter of urgency.,303,232
"Similarly, our Health Service needs a properly resourced plan to reduce waiting lists and a dedicated Transformation Fund to support reform.",504,233
Health is fundamental to every person in Northern Ireland.,504,234
The DUP will continue to strive for a situation where key decisions about the enhancement of the NHS in Northern Ireland are free from party politics.,504,235
The DUP is committed to defending and improving our education system in Northern Ireland to ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed in life.,506,237
"We will fight for sufficient resources to be provided for frontline schools budgets,",506,238
and for greater autonomy in decision making for schools.,506,239
"We support academic selection,",506,240
"the maintenance of the Dickson Plan,",506,241
and greater value being placed on vocational qualifications.,411,242
"We will focus on tackling educational underachievement through support for early years interventions,",506,243
n expanded childcare strategy,506,244
and community based initiatives.,606.1,245
"The DUP supports equality of treatment for all education sectors, including removal of discrimination in teacher employment,",503,246
as well as increased shared education across all education sectors.,506,247
Maintaining law and order is one of governments primary duties.,605.1,249
The DUP supports the justice family across the United Kingdom in the fight against crime in all its increasingly complex guises.,605.1,250
The DUP supports: The adoption a Problem Solving approach in our courts;,605.1,251
A measure of protection for the Police in future Budgets;,605.1,252
An increased focus on cyber crime;,605.1,253
the introduction of a NI Register of Animal Cruelty Offenders,501,254
and the seriousness of these animal cruelty offences reflected in the sentences handed down by courts;,501,255
the PSNI in their efforts to target criminal gangs and ensure they have all the powers necessary to seize assets of paramilitary godfathers,605.1,256
The DUP does not believe that the present defence arrangements for the United Kingdom are adequate enough to cope with the emerging threats in the 21st Century.,104,258
"We appreciate that in a time of significant challenge to public finances, almost all areas will be affected, but more consideration needs to be given to prioritising the funding of defence.",104,259
"In order to afford it some protection, the DUP supported the UK maintaining the NATO target of 2% of GDP for the Defence Budget, despite reservations about the funding formula.",104,260
"However, it would be unwise to allow the present funding, strength and plans for our Armed Forces to become the accepted norm.",104,261
History demonstrates that re-growing defence capability in times of national crisis is both disproportionately expensive and too late.,104,262
It should be remembered that the NATO target is intended as a minimum figure not a ceiling for Defence expenditure.,104,263
There is also legitimacy to the charge that the UK has only maintained the 2% target through a new definition of Defence spending.,104,264
"In the next term, it is expected that the UK public finances should improve.",104,265
When we achieve this we believe Defence should be one of the priorities for new investment.,104,266
"Recent harrowing events in Manchester highlight the fact that the strategic threat of the Cold War escalating to a nuclear conflict has been replaced by a multiplicity of threats, both conventional and unconventional, and not just from states but also from trans-national groups of linked terror movements.",104,267
This has triggered the emergence of a multitude of terrorist threats,104,268
and precipitated the current migration crisis in Europe.,601.2,269
"Additionally, Jihadists returning to the United Kingdom represent a new and highly dangerous threat.",104,270
This means the capabilities of our Defence and Intelligence infrastructure needs strengthened with a focus on the ability of our forces to deploy rapidly and to adapt to emerging threats.,104,271
We must not ignore dissident Republican terrorists and the threat they pose to all our citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.,605.1,272
The intelligence community and our security forces must be given a budget and rules of engagement that enable them not only to deter the threat from Republican splinter groups but also to actively pursue such terrorists and defeat them.,605.1,273
This is the DUPs Plan to strengthen the UKs Defences and support service personnel and veterans.,104,274
When the public finances improve we believe it will be appropriate to have a new National Security and Strategic Defence Review.,104,276
The 2015 Review demonstrated a lack of strategic ambition and was too much a product of expenditure limitations.,104,277
The DUP believes that such a review needs to be honest about the nature of the threats we face and the consequences of failing to deal with them.,104,278
Only then can we make the difficult choices about capability and affordability.,104,279
"In terms of military doctrine, we believe our military capability should be driven by the ability to act alone in defence of our own strategic interests in places like the Falkland Islands",104,280
"whilst also continuing to be the partner of choice to our allies, primarily through NATO.",104,281
"Within our military capabilities, the DUP believes the sufficient staffing, training and equipping of our reserve forces must be a priority.",104,282
The DUP has consistently supported the maintenance of the UKs independent nuclear deterrent and will continue to support Tridents renewal.,104,284
One of the reasons for the need to renew is the systematic failure of the international community to deal with the issue of nuclear proliferation.,104,285
We believe the UK should use all international forums to completely overhaul the approaches to counter proliferation and support efforts to prevent the likes of North Korean dictatorships from gaining and distributing such technology.,104,286
The DUP supports our participation in NATO but shares the American concerns that other members are consistently failing to fulfil the minimum spending target.,104,288
The Russian state is becoming more belligerent in its actions based on its assessment of western political and military weakness.,104,289
This pattern of behaviour will only be arrested by a reversal of both of these weaknesses.,104,290
Cybersecurity is recognised as the current dominant threat to global security.,104,292
Part of the growth of the knowledge economy in Northern Ireland has been a specialism in the area of cybersecurity.,104,293
The DUP believes this is a critical area where Northern Ireland could contribute to countering this growing threat to national security.,104,294
We support the expansion of cybersecurity research in Northern Ireland.,104,295
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom with both an immense contribution to our Armed Forces and debt to our Armed Forces for the protection they provided in the successful execution of Operation Banner.,104,297
These are why fulfilling the Military Covenant is particularly important for us.,601.1,298
We believe that the Military Covenant should be reviewed and updated.,601.1,299
The DUP supports the introduction of Independent Commissioners in the four parts of the United Kingdom to ensure the Covenant is fully implemented.,601.1,300
The DUP is conscious how equality legislation in Northern Ireland has been used to hamper the fulfilment of both the spirit and the practical elements of the Covenant here.,601.1,301
It wishes to see this situation ended and Veterans in Northern Ireland to be treated equally to Veterans right across the United Kingdom.,705,302
It is unacceptable that Northern Ireland has never hosted the main national event for Armed Forces Day in the UK.,601.1,304
The DUP wish to see Northern Ireland host the main national event at some point in the life of the next Parliament and regularly thereafter.,601.1,305
The DUP believes that considering the multi-faceted evolving and insidious nature of the terrorist threat it is time to review whether present arrangements need to be updated or upgraded.,605.1,307
This review should include: An updated legal framework for intelligence led anti-terrorism investigations and operations in the U.K.,605.1,308
A UK wide definition of a victim which excludes perpetrators.,605.1,309
Changes to the glorification of terrorism offences with an examination of the 20 year time limit.,605.1,310
Consideration of intelligence and security committee membership representing all regions of the UK,605.1,311
Ninety percent of the deaths in the Troubles were by paramilitaries yet the balance of investigations is disproportionately against former police officers and soldiers.,605.1,313
A one-sided approach only serves those who want to re-write the past.,601.1,314
It is only natural that the public are outraged to see former soldiers who stood against the brutal terrorism of the early seventies instigated by the IRA now being hounded while many of those who hid behind balaclavas avoid justice.,605.1,315
"The recent Defence Select Committees report  Investigation into Fatalities in Northern Ireland involving British Personnel recommends Government bring forward a statute of limitations, following a DUP led debate in Parliament.",605.1,316
The DUP also managed to secure Committee backing to extend such a proposal to include members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and other security personnel.,305.1,317
The last twenty years have been marred by the completely imbalanced treatment of those who terrorised our society compared against brave service personnel who ensured they would never succeed.,605.1,318
"Early release of prisoners, a maximum two year sentence for fresh terrorist convictions, odious On the Runs legislation and a secretive scheme to issue letters of immunity have all tarnished the process of justice.",605.1,319
"Our troubled past can only be dealt with effectively in an honest and holistic manner, not the partial way republicans would wish.",305.1,320
We must ensure that the past cannot be rewritten.,601.1,321
Government should go ahead and publish their draft legislation so the new Historical Investigations Unit can commence its work as soon as possible.,605.1,322
We will do everything we can to assist innocent victims to obtain a measure of justice.,605.1,323
WHY WE SUPPORTED A VOTE TO LEAVE:,110,325
The DUPs decision to support leaving the European Union was based on principle and practicality.,110,326
"The DUP had opposed joining in the first place, had been consistent in its scepticism throughout our membership and fully supported the question of membership being put to the people of the United Kingdom.",110,327
This was the demonstration of our commitment to principle.,110,328
In terms of practicality when the then Prime Minister David Cameron attempted to achieve tangible reform of the European Union we supported this initiative.,110,329
In our previous Westminster manifesto the DUP stated: We support the current UK Government pledge to renegotiate elements of our relationship with the European Union.,110,330
The deafness of the EU institutions to change in those negotiations meant that this process did not deliver the fundamental reform the EU required.,110,331
"Therefore, with no reasonable alternative available, the DUP chose to maintain its stance and advocate for a leave vote.",110,332
Some would seek to make this a re-run of last years referendum.,305.1,333
Our job now is not to refight old battles but to use our mandate and our influence to get the best deal for Northern Ireland.,305.1,334
The United Kingdoms departure from the European Union inevitably brings with it opportunities as well as challenges.,110,335
"Whichever way people voted in the referendum last June, and whatever concerns they may still have we can all unite to ensure Northern Irelands interests are promoted.",606.1,336
"For our part we will work to get the best deal for Northern Ireland, recognizing that we share a land frontier with the Republic and the particular circumstances of our unique history and geography.",601.1,337
The circumstances of Northern Ireland are well understood and working together sensibly we have the opportunity to secure a good outcome that delivers for everyone.,601.1,338
"In the new Parliament, Northern Ireland needs to have a strong, united DUP team arguing the case for our people.",606.2,339
Successful outward-looking knowledge-based economy in Northern Ireland,411,341
Ease of trade with the Irish Republic and throughout the European Union,407,342
Maintenance of the Common Travel Area,407,343
Strengthened relationships across the four components parts of the United Kingdom with no internal borders,407,344
Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved through active Executive engagement,301,345
Particular circumstances of Northern Ireland with a land border with the EU fully reflected,101,346
Frictionless border with Irish Republic assisting those working or travelling in the other jurisdiction,101,347
Progress on new free trade deals with the rest of the world,407,348
Comprehensive free trade and customs agreement with the European Union,407,349
Northern Ireland established as a hub for trade from Irish Republic into the broader UK market,301,350
Customs arrangements which facilitate trade with new and existing markets,407,351
Confidence and capacity within local businesses to maximize opportunities,416.2,352
Business to retain competiveness and not face additional costs,401,353
"Arrangements to facilitate ease of movement of people, goods and services",407,354
"Proportionate regulatory regime which can promote competiveness, with legislation to suit our local needs",403,355
Local input into new UK agriculture and fisheries policies which can offer sustainability and new growth opportunities,416.2,356
Particular importance of agri-food sector to Northern Ireland economy recognised and reflected,703.1,357
Strong protections for agri-food to guard against vulnerabilities to cheap inferior imports,703.1,358
An appropriate support programme for our farmers should continue after we leave,703.1,359
"Effective immigration policy which meets the skills, labour and security needs of the UK",411,360
Rights of British citizens in the EU and those from EU member states living here safeguarded,201.2,361
Energy market stability,411,362
"Effective, time bound transitional arrangements where necessary",110,363
Higher and further education continuing to attract international expertise and collaboration,411,364
Ability to opt-in to EU funds where proven to be cost-effective and add value,107,365
Continued participation in funding programmes that have been proven to be of benefit and are open to non-EU members e.g. research funding,107,366
Fair share for Northern Ireland from dividends from leaving the EU,601.1,367
UK wide skills and infrastructure funds should be established to lead with an emphasis on regional specialisations,411,368
Jurisdiction of European Court of Justice ended and greater control over our laws restored,110,369
Positive ongoing relationship with European Union in keeping with Article 8 of Lisbon Treaty.,108,370
It is in the interests of all in Northern Ireland that the UK-EU negotiations progress well,110,371
and that the trade elements commence as soon as possible.,407,372
"The stronger and more positive the agreements reached, especially on trade and customs relationships, then the better for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland",407,373
The role and importance of identity is an increasing issue of discussion across the Western world.,607.1,375
The development and impact of globalisation had led many to assume that identity was inexorably fading away.,607.1,376
This is not true.,607.1,377
The desire to be from somewhere remains inherent in many and played an important role across many recent elections.,607.1,378
"Simply put, identity matters.",607.1,379
"In a Northern Ireland context, the DUP Leader Arlene Foster has commenced an ongoing process of engagement around how identity is treated in Northern Ireland.",607.1,380
The aim of this is to develop a real respect agenda on the issue of identity here.,607.1,381
Respect does not mean simply acceding to everything asked for or demanded by different groups or communities.,608.1,382
"Instead, it is a dialogue of what is wanted, what is needed and what can be practically delivered to ensure the expression of an identity and its successful communication to the next generation.",607.1,383
"In this dialogue, an important place must be made for our growing minority ethnic communities to ensure their contribution to our diversity",607.1,384
and to integrate into our society.,608.1,385
While the desires of the Irish language community have been highlighted it would be a mistake to assume that this means there is contentment with the present identity settlement amongst the variety of cultural expressions in Northern Ireland.,607.1,386
The commentary and manifestation of disrespect is not exclusive to one identity or one form of expression.,607.1,387
"An obvious example is the continuing targeting of Orange Halls for physical attack while political parties, with cheerleading from sections of the media, attack any public funds going to them.",607.1,388
In the spirit of contributing to a genuine discussion and development of a real respect agenda the DUP would see a number of areas of concern that need to be addressed.,607.1,389
The DUP believes these reflect the identity concerns of different cross-sections of those who support Unionism and in some cases beyond it.,607.1,390
It does not claim to be exhaustive or prescriptive for all different identities here but to contribute to the discussion and development of a real respect agenda.,607.1,391
These concerns fit within three broad categories: Our British Identity,601.1,392
Our Ulster Identities,601.1,393
Our Pride in Northern Ireland,601.1,394
Within this context there are four broad areas where progress is sought.,601.1,396
These include:,601.1,397
"For significant periods of recent history, there has been a consistent attempt to reduce the display of British symbols.",601.1,399
This process was particularly aggressive in Northern Ireland.,601.1,400
It was commonly referred to as  hol lowing out Ulsters Britishness but the process was not exclusive to Northern Ireland.,601.1,401
More recent times have shown a greater desire to display national symbols in the public realm and greater embracing of Britishness.,601.1,402
Northern Ireland has been excluded from this process.,601.1,403
"For example, Northern Irelands flag legislation has seen a consistent reduction in days while Nationalist ministers blocked a simple measure like the Union flag on driving licences, rejecting even an opt-in option.",601.1,404
"Therefore, there is a clear desire that this exclusion of Northern Ireland from these positive developments for the public expression of Britishness ends.",601.1,405
The celebration and commemoration of important national events are central to the maintenance and promotion of a common identity.,601.1,407
"The full enjoyment, celebration and/or participation in them needs to be guaranteed.",601.1,408
"Examples of how this has not been occurring are Homecoming parades, the Armed Forces Day National event and the Battlefield Tours programme.",601.1,409
There were demonstrations against Homecoming parades.,601.1,410
"Northern Ireland has never hosted the main national event for Armed Forces Day, unlike every other constituent part of the UK.",601.1,411
Schools from Northern Ireland have only just started participating on a pilot basis in WW1 Battlefield tours.,601.1,412
These commenced elsewhere in the UK in 2014 and NIs exclusion was the result of Sinn Feins control of the education and cultural ministries.,601.1,413
"Our Armed Forces, their sacrifices and their achievements are a central and continuing bond.",104,415
The debt that is owed to these men and women is expressed through the Military Covenant.,104,416
The inequality that sees veterans In Northern Ireland not enjoying the full benefits of this covenant is not something that the DUP considers in any way acceptable.,705,417
"Thus, a framework to: ensure its complete fulfilment;",705,418
support research on veterans needs and acting on its recommendations; and,705,419
"proper structures with ongoing oversight, is required.",705,420
"Likewise, to encourage our future contribution to the military our Cadet services in Northern Ireland should receive comparable support arrangements as elsewhere in UK",104,421
and the development of a new Army Museum in Northern Ireland should be seen as an opportunity for significant development.,601.1,422
Our membership of the EU meant the Commonwealth and its contribution was often overlooked.,101,424
Its peoples have contributed so much to the diversity of modern Britain and is an international network we must utilise better at pursuing our mutual interests.,101,425
The role and contribution of the Commonwealth should be better promoted in our schools.,101,426
Northern Ireland should seek to host Commonwealth political and sporting events and maximise the range of sports in which Northern Ireland teams participate.,101,427
Beyond these themes the DUP would also like to see the development of a UK equivalent of Co-operation Ireland promoting the linkages across the constituent parts of the country.,302,428
"The Ulster-Scots heritage, language and culture and Orangeism have both made a huge contribution to our own local identity as well as having a significant impact beyond our shores.",607.1,430
"However, their birth and strength remain here.",607.1,431
When you consider the breadth and depth of the Ulster-Scots identity the range of measures and opportunities that could be pursued is long.,607.1,433
"At its core there must be reform and resourcing of the Ulster-Scots Agency,",607.1,434
refocusing of the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund,607.1,435
and fulfilling the 2003 promise to create an Ulster-Scots Academy.,607.1,436
"These developments would facilitate the likes of language promotion,",607.1,437
"tourism initiatives,",408,438
"capital investment,",401,439
"cultural networks,",502,440
"diaspora development,",602.1,441
"social economy projects,",504,442
inclusion in the education system and bespoke courses,506,443
", academic research",411,444
and digital and broadcasting growth.,411,445
It is a continuing contradiction that despite all the talk of rights in Northern Ireland many of the same people are silent about or opposed to freedom of assembly.,201.2,447
Public expression by parades is central to Orangeism but over the years regardless of who was on the Parades Commissions the end result has been the same.,201.2,448
"Namely, the exclusion of Orangeism from ever greater areas of public space.",201.2,449
This is regardless of engagement or not or compliance or not and often rewarded violence.,201.2,450
Thus the DUP is committed to a new start on parades.,201.2,451
The pride in Northern Ireland that many feel in what we can achieve together or individually is something the DUP wishes to promote and believes would be attractive to a broad cross-section of people in Northern Ireland.,606.1,453
This would include:,601.1,454
"Despite an agreement of Executive support for the Decade of Centenaries, this led to little practical action.",601.1,456
The DUP does not want that to be the case in 2021.,601.1,457
It will be a clear opportunity for us to celebrate what has been achieved in the previous 100 years but equally to look forward to what we want to achieve in the next century.,601.1,458
"The programme for this should include a public holiday,",601.1,459
"public art,",502,460
"an Expo,",502,461
"centenary wood and greenway,",501,462
securing of major sporting events,502,463
and practical measures to demonstrate our values such as baby boxes and awards for centenarians.,601.1,464
"The recognition of Northern Ireland can be given practical effect in a number of ways, for example:",601.1,466
"Within our museums, a narrative of a global, positive and innovative Northern Ireland that achieved economic success and is dedicated to regaining such a position again;",601.1,467
Recognition for the symbols associated with Northern Ireland; and,601.1,468
"Recognition of Northern Ireland sporting bodies,",601.1,469
the Olympic team should be referred to as Team UK,601.1,470
and the freedom for athletes to choose their national team.,502,471
"Sinn Fein have used their mandate at the last Assembly election to demand a destabilising Border Poll, to push a republican agenda and to block the re-establishment of the Assembly.",305.1,473
Its time for unionists to come out and vote so the real voice of Northern Ireland is heard.,305.1,474
A vote for the DUP is a vote ... For Northern Irelands place within the United Kingdom,601.1,475
For real influence at Westminster,305.1,476
For the best deal for Northern Ireland as the UK leaves the EU,110,477
For the strongest representation at Westminster,305.1,478
For the restoration of the Assembly and Executive,305.3,479
"If you want the DUP to be Northern Irelands voice at Westminster so we can stand up for unionism, speak up for Northern Ireland, and stop Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein from dictating the political agenda, then you must send that message by voting for the DUP.",305.1,480
Use your vote to unite around the biggest and strongest unionist party.,305.1,481
Vote DUP!,305.1,482
If only all politicians could believe in Britain as UKIP does.,601,6
"If only they could share our positive vision of Britain as a proud, independent sovereign nation,",601,7
"a country respected on the world stage,",601,8
"a major player in global trade,",601,9
with influence and authority when it comes to tackling the pressing international issues of the day.,601,10
This manifesto is our blueprint for a Britain released from the shackles of the interfering EU.,110,11
This makes it markedly different to those of the other main parties.,110,12
"While we see a free, prosperous, healthy, international future for Britain, their cowardice binds our country to a failing super-state that tells us what to do and does not listen to what we want.",110,13
"Our manifesto also throws down the gauntlet to those who have ridiculed us, jeered at us and lied about our voters, our people and our policies.",305,14
It tells the truth about what UKIP stands for.,305,15
It takes care of Britains finances too.,408,16
"Taxpayers could get so much better value for their money if we left the EU,",110,17
"made reasonable cuts to the foreign aid budget,",109,18
"replaced the unfair Barnett formula,",404,19
"scrapped HS2,",404,20
ended health tourism,404,21
and cut the cost of government.,303,22
These are our plans and they give us a budget to invest in Britain the other parties can only dream of.,404,23
"Without adding a penny to our burgeoning national debt, without cutting vital services and without raising taxes, we can, over the course of the next parliament:",404,24
Invest an extra £12 billion into the NHS;,504,25
put £5.2 billion more into social care;,504,26
build a dedicated military hospital,504,27
and abolish hospital parking charges,504,28
End income tax on the minimum wage;,503,29
cut income taxes for middle earners;,503,30
scrap inheritance tax;,503,31
abolish the bedroom tax,503,32
and increase the transferable personal tax allowance for married couples and civil partners,503,33
"Fund 6,000 additional posts spread between the police service, the prison service and the Border Agency",605,34
Cut business rates for small businesses,402,35
Waive tuition fees for students taking a degree in science; technology; engineering; maths or medicine,506,36
Increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP to honour our NATO obligations,104,37
Invest £1.5 billion into mental health and dementia services,504,38
Pay carers an extra £572 a year,504,39
Build 500 affordable rent homes every year,409,40
and eight halfway house hostels for homeless veterans,409,41
"Remove stamp duty on the first £250,000 for new homes built on brownfield sites.",409,42
Our fiscal plans identifying how we will fund these policies have been rigorously and independently assessed by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr).,404,43
"The Cebr has been extremely diligent and has challenged us frequently, so voters can be assured our manifesto commitments are sound and affordable.",404,44
"Ours is an amazing country, but it could be better still.",601,45
As Mark Reckless said when he joined UKIP last year: we are more than just a star on someone elses flag.,601,46
Our approach to the economy revolves around restoring incentives for workers by cutting taxes,701,51
and ending the current open door arrangement for European labour that has driven down wages in recent years.,110,52
"By the end of the next parliament, UKIP will: Raise the personal allowance to at least £13,000 so people can earn enough money to cover their basic living costs before the state starts to take income tax out of their pay packets.",503,53
This will take those on minimum wage out of tax altogether,503,54
Abolish inheritance tax.,404,55
Assets bought out of taxed income should not be taxed again when their owners die.,404,56
We will strike out the hated death tax.,503,57
"It hits the middle classes hardest, those who have worked to provide for their dependents, because the wealthiest almost always manage to avoid paying it",503,58
"Raise the threshold for paying 40 per cent income tax to £55,000",404,59
"and introduce a new intermediate tax rate of 30 per cent on incomes ranging between £43,500 and £55,000.",404,60
A tax originally designed for high earners should not be levied on middle-income earners such as school teachers and senior nurses,404,61
"Increase the transferable tax allowance for married couples and civil partners to £1,500.",404,62
"The longer term aspiration of a UKIP government will be to create an income tax structure of a basic rate of 20 per cent, an intermediate rate of 30 per cent, and a top rate of 40 per cent, meaning income taxes will be flatter and lower.",404,63
Bringing down taxes on working people at the bottom and in the middle ranges of the income scale is our priority.,503,64
"In the longer term, we will aim to restore the personal allowance to those earning over £100,000 and make 40 per cent the top rate of tax for all, as it used to be.",503,65
"Outside the EU, we will have control over VAT.",110,67
"Significantly, we will be able to deal with distortion imposed by EU legislation and zero-rate certain goods and services that have previously had VAT charged on them.",110,68
"This means we can  and will - remove VAT completely from repairs to listed buildings and sanitary products, for example.",110,69
It is grossly unfair that a few multi-national corporations have been able to access all the benefits of our thriving British consumer market without making a proper contribution to the costs of British society.,403,71
The public has every right to be angry about this.,403,72
"By restoring British tax sovereignty, which we lost when we signed up to the EU,",110,74
we will end the practice of businesses paying tax in whichever EU or associated country they choose.,403,75
Our membership of the EU enables companies to avoid paying some UK taxes with impunity and we will close this loophole.,110,76
We will also set up a Treasury Commission to monitor the effectiveness of the new Diverted Profits Tax and bring in any further measures necessary to prevent large multinational corporations using aggressive tax avoidance schemes.,403,77
Years of mismanagement by Labour and Conservative governments have left our public finances in a mess.,414,79
"The public sector deficit in 2014/15 is expected to be around £90 billion and our national debt close to £1.5 trillion, £500 billion more than it was when David Cameron took over in 2010.",414,80
This is a terrible legacy to leave our children and grandchildren.,414,81
"Interest payments on our national debt alone cost £46 billion every year: more than £700 for every man, woman and child in the country.",414,82
It is more than we are spending on defence.,104,83
"The Chancellor has failed to stick to his 2010 promise to wipe out the deficit by the end of the current parliament, despite damaging cuts to public services.",414,84
"In the March 2015 Budget, a new deficit reduction schedule was unveiled, envisaging the elimination of the deficit by the third year of the next parliament, with a surplus being recorded after that.",414,85
"While this current Treasury plan is a reasonable target, there is little public faith it will be achieved, coming as is does in the wake of previous failure.",414,86
"UKIP MPs in the next parliament will make sure the Treasury sticks to this latest plan, with no backsliding.",414,87
We will hold the next Chancellors feet to the fire when it comes to improving public finances.,414,88
"UKIP will make a difference by being a powerful, much-needed voice in favour of sound financial management.",414,89
UKIP will finance a fairer tax system and fund our public spending proposals by sharp reductions in spending on specified public sector programmes.,414,91
By the end of the next parliament we will: Save £9 billion a year in direct net contributions to the European Union budget by leaving the EU,110,92
"Reduce the overseas aid budget from 0.7 per cent to  0.2 per cent of GNI, matching the percentage contribution made by the USA.",109,93
This change will be phased in so projects in progress can be completed and contractual obligations met.,109,94
Annual savings will increase to £11 billion by 2019/20 and money for bilateral aid projects will not be languishing in EU bank accounts,110,95
"Save £4 billion a year in capital expenditure by scrapping the HS2 vanity project, which will benefit the few at the expense of many",414,96
Reduce spending by £5.5 billion by replacing the Barnett Formula,414,97
"The Barnett Formula is the method by which HM Treasury allocates funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",303,99
"Despite being in existence for thirty-seven years, since when we have seen devolution and significant changes in the respective countries fortunes, this formula has never been reviewed or updated.",303,100
"Now discredited, it was disowned by Lord Barnett himself.",303,101
UKIP believes the Barnett Formula has passed its sell-by date.,303,102
"Spending has become increasingly unfair, with Scotland receiving  a considerably higher per capita spend, despite moving towards  further tax-raising and spending powers of its own.",503,103
"Scotland receives almost £1,400 more per person in public spending than the UK average and nearly £450 more than Wales.",503,104
This is why Scotland is able to spend in a manner not possible elsewhere in the UK.,503,105
We agree with the House of Lords Select Committee on the Barnett Formula which in 2009 concluded that: The Barnett Formula results in per capita allocations that are arbitrary and unfair,503,106
Scotland has markedly lower overall need than Wales,503,107
The Barnett Formula should no longer be used to determine annual increases in the block grant for the devolved administration,503,108
A new system which allocates resources to the devolved administrations based on an explicit assessment of their relative needs should be introduced,503,109
A formula based on relative need is a practical possibility.,503,110
"These conclusions echoed a House of Commons Justice Committee report in the same year, which stated: The Barnett Formula is overdue for reform and lacks any basis in equity or logic.",303,111
"The government of the day was urged to devise a new, needs-based formula.",305,112
Both reports have been ignored.,305,113
"UKIP will implement these recommendations within the time frame anticipated by the House of Lords Select Committee: a transitional period of between three and five years, preferably no more than seven.",303,114
"The introduction of a new system will result in substantial reductions in funding for Scotland,",503,115
"but, as the Scottish government is to have significant further powers over taxation, borrowing and spending in due course, it can make its own decision as to whether to raise taxes or cut public spending to balance the books.",301,116
"Either way, the devolved administration in Scotland will be well placed to balance its fiscal, economic and spending priorities.",301,117
"The cost to the taxpayer of the Houses of Parliament, Ministerial Departments, the Home Civil Service and Whitehall-funded quangos is huge, running into hundreds of millions of pounds every year.",303,119
UKIP believes we can make considerable savings,303,120
at the same time as improving democratic accountability.,202,121
These savings include: Reducing the size of the House of Commons and ensuring parliamentary constituencies across the country are of equal size,303,122
Abolishing government departments when their essential powers and functions can be merged into other departments.,303,123
"Such departments will include the Department for Energy and Climate Change,",303,124
"the Department for International Development,",303,125
"and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport",303,126
"Reducing the number of secretaries of state, ministers and parliamentary undersecretaries-of-state and, accordingly, the size of government",303,127
Cutting departmental running costs where they do not deliver value for money,303,128
Reducing the £7.2 million cost of paid advisers and bring more transparency to their appointment,303,129
"Abolishing unnecessary quangos such as the Cabinet Offices Big Society programme (£49 million),",303,130
"the National Citizen Service (£62 million),",303,131
DfIDs International Citizen Service Volunteers (£110 million),303,132
and Defras Waste Resource Action Programme (£15.5 million),303,133
"Clamping down on so-called fake charities,",303,134
or state-funded political activism,303,135
Ending tax-payer funded overseas junketing and non-essential fact-finding missions,303,136
Ceasing all subsidies for bars and dining rooms in the Palace of Westminster,303,137
"Preventing MPs claiming expenses that are not incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of their duties, like every other member of society.",303,138
We anticipate investing savings made from cutting the cost of Westminster into a dedicated fund to contribute to the repair and maintenance of the beautiful and historic Palace of Westminster.,303,139
The fabric of this building has been neglected and the estimated cost of essential repairs is currently £3 billion.,303,140
Government has focused on the wrong spending priorities for far too long.,305,141
"It is time to stop wasting money on trying to be popular on the world stage, and  start tackling urgent, pressing  needs here in the UK.",601,142
By changing our spending priorities British taxpayers can get much better value for money.,414,143
UKIP will take Britain out of the red and back  into the black.,414,144
The increasing ebb and flow of people across our planet is one of the greatest issues of our time.,601,147
"In 1950s Britain, some 25,000 immigrants arrived here annually and net migration was negligible.",601,148
"Now, immigration into the UK is at an all time high:",601,149
"in the year to September 2014, 624,000 migrants moved to our island and annual net migration, which takes into account those leaving the country, now stands at 298,000, again, a new record",601,150
Nearly seven million immigrants came to the UK when the Blair and Brown Labour governments deliberately and recklessly threw open our borders between 1997 and 2010.,601,151
Over two million more have arrived since David Cameron came to power and spectacularly broke his promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousandsNo ifs. No buts.,601,152
"This unprecedented influx has had significant consequences on our economy, our public services, our culture and our environment.",601,153
Evidence from the EU and the UK Parliaments Treasury Select Committee reveals how immigration has driven down wages and led to job losses for British workers.,601,154
"The sheer weight of numbers, combined with rising birth rates (particularly to immigrant mothers) and an ageing population, is pushing public services to breaking point.",601,155
"To meet demand, we must build one home every seven minutes;",601,156
we wait longer to see our GP or be treated in hospitals;,601,157
"our children are learning in schools with over-sized classes,  or having lessons disrupted by building work as schools are forced to keep expanding.",601,158
The British public has every right to be concerned.,601,159
Surveys consistently show immigration as one of the top three issues for voters.,601,160
"Yet, instead of listening, the old parties have responded with insults and contempt: even our prime ministers have labelled good, decent people closet racists and bigots.",305,161
Immigration is not about race; it is about space.,601,162
Immigrants are not the problem; it is the current immigration system that is broken.,110,163
Our current immigration rules ignore the wishes of the British people.,601,164
They discriminate in favour of EU citizens and against the rest of the world.,110,165
The system is failing so badly that we cannot even properly identify how many people enter and leave our country.,110,166
Take back control of our borders,110,168
"Put  a  five-year  moratorium  on  immigration  for  unskilled  workers,  which will enable the unemployed already living here to find work and those already working to see wage growth",406,169
"Introduce  an  Australian-style  points  based  system  to  manage  the  number and skills of people coming into the country,",406,170
"treating all citizens of the world on a fair and equal basis as a welcoming, outward-looking country",503,171
Tackle the problem of sham marriages.,605,172
"These policies are essential if we are to give our country the breathing space it desperately needs from mass uncontrolled immigration,",406,173
"create harmonious, integrated communities,",608,174
and catch up on building the essential infrastructure needed to sustain our growing nation.,411,175
We can never control immigration while we continue to be members of the European Union.,110,177
"Until we leave, we are forced to abide by the EUs founding, unshakable principle of the free movement of people, meaning we cannot prevent the flow of citizens from all EU member states into Britain.",110,178
"Other political parties will promise to control immigration, but while they continue to support the UKs membership of the EU, they are not being honest with the electorate.",110,179
"Wholly unable to control EU migration, they can only reduce numbers by slamming the door in the face of people from around the rest of the world.",110,180
"The old parties already support blatant discrimination against Commonwealth countries, with whom Britain has traditionally had long and friendly relationships.",101,181
"This inequality will at best continue and at worst increase, under their prejudicial immigration policies.",110,182
"UKIP will: Increase the numbers of Border Agency staff by 2,500",605,183
"Implement  new  border  control  technology  solutions  to ensure all passport and visa holders are counted in and out and to identify over-stayers, including those on student visas.",605,184
We will establish a Migration Control Commission to oversee operation of our Australian-style points based system.,406,186
This commission will operate under a strict mandate to significantly reduce the numbers of people migrating to the UK.,406,187
"It will determine Britains economic and social needs annually and then recommend how many immigrants, with what skills required, we will accept into Britain.",406,188
"Because the other parties have failed to control immigration, UKIP will limit highly-skilled work visas to 50,000 per annum,",406,189
"including those from the EU,",110,190
and apply a moratorium to unskilled and low-skilled labour over the course of the next parliament.,406,191
"UKIP has no intention of pulling up the drawbridge to Britain, as has been suggested.",406,192
"We simply want to control who walks over it, like nearly 200 other countries worldwide.",406,193
"A new visa system will be operated on a strict principle of non-discrimination between peoples of all nations applying to work, study and visit the United Kingdom.",503,195
We will offer five principal visa categories: Work  Visas  will be issued to skilled and key workers under our Australian-style points  based system.,406,196
Workers under this scheme will be required to have medical insurance to cover both themselves and any dependent s for five years duration.,406,197
"During this time they will not be able to claim any benefits or non-urgent NHS treatment, unless they can be treated under any reciprocal international agreements or have been granted a specific exception by the Migration Control Commission.",406,198
"Those arriving on work visas will not be granted permanent leave to remain, however they can apply for British citizenship after five years if they have worked and paid tax here.",406,199
"Visitor visas and entry passes-We value and want to encourage tourism, however there are inequalities in the current system, which treats some nationalities more favourably than others.",406,200
"The Migration Control Commission will be charged with finding a system which enables countries with which the UK already has close ties, such as member states of the European Union and the Commonwealth, to establish reciprocal arrangements for visitor visas and term-dated entry passes.",406,201
Student visas- The international student community makes an important contribution to the UK.,406,202
"Because students are in Britain only on a temporary basis, we will categorise them separately in immigration figures.",406,203
All non-UK undergraduate and post-graduate students will be required to maintain private health insurance for the period of their study.,505,204
We will also: Review which educational institutions are eligible to enroll international students and prevent abuse of the student visa system.,406,205
Students not attending courses will have their visas withdrawn and colleges not reporting absentees will be barred from accepting international students.,406,206
Family reunion visas - It is important that British citizens and those with permanent leave to remain here can form legal family relationships with non-British citizens and we will review the family union system to ensure this basic principle is respected and applies equally to all.,503,207
"However, our key aim is to control immigration, so we will abolish the EEA family permit scheme and reinstate the primary purpose rule, meaning foreign nationals marrying British citizens will have to prove that the primary purpose of their marriage is not to obtain British residency.",406,208
Asylum visas -We will comply fully with the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees;,107,209
speed up the asylum process;,303,210
and seek to do so while tackling logjams in the system for those declined asylum status.,303,211
We will continue to honour our obligations to bona fide asylum seekers.,107,212
"We have an over-stretched NHS and a high benefits bill, partly because of the pressure from immigration.",601,214
"To combat this, all new migrants to Britain will have to make tax and national insurance contributions for five consecutive years before they will become eligible to claim UK benefits, or access to more than non-urgent NHS services, save for any exceptions stipulated by the Migration Control Commission.",601,215
"Save for current applications, approved asylum cases and family reunions, we will cease grant of Permanent Leave to Remain status.",601,217
Those on work visas may apply for British citizenship once they have been here for five years.,601,218
We will revoke the British citizenship of those who have obtained it by fraud or deception and remove those who have obtained entry into Britain by this means.,601,219
We take the view that British citizens who choose to fight alongside terrorist organisations effectively abdicate their rights to citizenship.,601,220
We will amend the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 to make enlistment in violent armed groups or transnational terror organisations a crime,605,221
and we will seek a means to revoke their citizenship and prevent their repatriation.,601,222
There will be no amnesty for illegal immigrants.,605,224
We will increase the number of immigration compliance and enforcement teams,605,225
and review current holding and accommodation arrangements for illegal immigrants.,605,226
Foreign criminals will not be granted a visa to enter the UK,605,228
Resident migrants who commit crimes resulting in custodial sentence will have their visa revoked and they will be subject to a deportation order.,605,229
They will be detained until they are removed from the UK.,605,230
Our new immigration policies will begin when we confirm our intention to leave the EU with an out vote in a national referendum.,110,232
Any European Union citizen who is resident in the UK at the time of the referendum will be permitted to remain and work here.,108,233
They will be able to enjoy the benefits of the UK as before and have the opportunity to apply for UK citizenship after five years.,601,234
The British people accept immigrants and are among the most welcoming and tolerant people in the world.,601,235
UKIPs policies recognise the new openness in our world and the positive benefits controlled immigration has brought and can continue to bring to our nation.,601,236
"Only UKIPs policies have, at their heart, sustainability, ethics and fairness.",305,237
"It is only by pursuing these policies and introducing an Australian-style points based system, that we can all be  confident immigration will benefit Britain.",601,238
Our ageing population;,504,242
"the dramatic increase in the numbers of people suffering chronic, long-term conditions;",504,243
"uncontrolled immigration, encouraged by Labour and continued under the Tories:",406,244
any one of these pressures might have been enough to bring the NHS close to breaking point.,504,245
Combine these with EU directives that have prevented essential training and endless political interference,110,246
and it is not difficult to understand why the NHS is in serious trouble.,504,247
Both Labour and the Tories have utterly failed our NHS by treating it as a political football instead of a cherished institution.,504,248
"Patients are suffering because of poor policy, made all too often purely for reasons of political expediency.",504,249
A GP appointment can no longer be guaranteed within any reasonable time frame.,504,250
Coalition cuts to social care budgets are forcing elderly people to stay in hospital for longer than they should because there is no after-care available for them.,504,251
Top-down targets forced on Accident and Emergency departments are not realistic; even some of the best hospitals cannot cope.,504,252
"Despite a chronic shortage of doctors, nurses and midwives",504,253
David Camerons government wasted billions on a top-down reorganisation he promised would not happen.,504,254
"Labour, which squandered money on financing capital projects at credit card rates through private finance initiatives and giving service contracts worth billions of pounds to private companies when they were in power, are now promising to repeal the Health and Social Care Act, meaning yet more billions will be wasted re-organising the NHS all over again.",504,255
Both parties administered a disastrous £12 billion NHS IT project which ultimately failed.,504,256
UKIP will take better care of taxpayers money.,504,257
We will put an additional £3 billion a year into the NHS in England by the end of the parliament and make sure the money is spent on frontline patient care.,504,258
"We will provide the common sense, the money, the staff, the social care funding and the vital improvements to emergency medicine that the NHS needs.",504,259
"We will fund: 8,000 MORE GPs",504,260
We will train and employ GPs to meet this current shortfall,504,261
and waive university tuition fees for new medical students who work in Britain for  five years after qualifying.,504,262
"To encourage those who have left the profession to get back into the surgery, we will fund the cost of re-training for GPs who wish to return to practice.",504,263
"To cut GP waiting times and allow GPs to spend more time actually seeing patients, UKIP will reduce the burden of data collection, target chasing, revalidation and appraisal work that interferes with the care GPs can give to patients.",504,264
"20,000 MORE NURSES",504,265
"AND  3,000 MORE MIDWIVES",504,266
"Not only will UKIP find the training of nurses and midwives, we will also fund return to practice training for those who have taken career breaks.",504,267
"Because we believe nursing starts and ends on the ward, we will bring back the State Enrolled Nurse, and put care and compassion back at the heart of nursing.",504,268
"There is a shortage of emergency medicine consultants in our Accident and Emergency departments, just 1200 when the profession needs closer to 2000.",504,270
"The problem stems not so much from a deficiency in training capacity, but from poor retention once registrars or consultants have qualified.",504,271
"500 UK-trained emergency medicine consultants are currently working in Australia, New Zealand and Canada alone, which illustrates the attrition rate.",504,272
"Bodies representing this field of medicine believe the solution lies in improving working conditions, such as the extent of weekend cover, unsocial hours, extended shifts and leave patterns.",504,273
"Funding the additional consultants is not in itself a problem, as the cost of locums to cover the current shortage far exceeds that of increasing employed staff and this is what we will do.",504,274
"Patients who cannot get a GP appointment frequently turn up in A&E instead, putting additional pressure on already over-stretched resources.",504,276
We will initiate pilot programmes in English hospitals to put GPs on duty in A&E departments seven days a week.,504,277
"If these pilots succeed in easing the burden on A&E staff by freeing them up to treat seriously ill patients more successfully, we will roll the programme out across the country, deploying approximately 1,000 of the 8,000 additional GPs we are committed to funding.",504,278
Patients with mental health problems frequently feel ignored and let down.,504,280
UKIP takes a whole  person approach to health and that means giving mental health parity with physical health.,504,281
"We will introduce practical policies to improve delivery of mental health services, including:",504,282
Directing patients diagnosed with a debilitating long-term condition or terminal illnesses to mental health professionals when appropriate,504,283
Recognising there is often a link between addiction and mental illness and offering appropriate treatment where this is the case,504,284
Offering direct access to specialist mental health treatment for pregnant women and mothers of children under 12 months of age,504,285
Fighting the stigma around mental illness,504,286
and supporting those seeking to get back into work.,504,287
Patients experiencing distress or exhibiting mental ill-health issues when admitted to hospital should have both their physical health and mental wellbeing assessed.,504,288
This must not just be an optional extra: we will end the postcode lottery for psychiatric liaison services in acute hospitals and A&E departments.,504,289
"To fund these initiatives, we will increase mental health funding by £170 million annually, phasing this in through the first two years of the next parliament.",504,290
This debilitating and distressing condition is the leading cause of death among women over the age of 55 and the fifth biggest killer of men.,504,292
We will be investing a full extra £130 million a year into researching and treating dementia by 2017.,504,293
UKIP will put the national back into our national health service,504,294
We need to get tough on so-called health-tourism.,505,295
Every year the NHS spends up to  £2 billion of UK taxpayers money treating those ineligible for free care.,505,296
This bill includes foreign nationals who come to Britain to deliberately seek NHS services at no cost to themselves;,505,297
those who live here but who do not qualify for free care;,505,298
treatment for illegal immigrants and those who overstay their visas.,505,299
"The NHS is the National Health Service, not the International Health Service.",505,300
UKIP will insist migrants and visitors who come to Britain have approved medical insurance.,505,301
Only those who have the permanent right to remain in Britain and who have paid UK taxes for at least five years will be granted an NHS number and be eligible for the full services offered by the NHS.,505,302
"Urgent medical treatment will still be given to those who need it, but non-urgent treatment will be charged for.",505,303
UKIP is the only party that is truly willing to face up to the harsh reality of how health tourism and treating those ineligible is sapping the NHS of funds.,505,304
The other parties have their heads stuck well and truly in the sand.,505,305
Hospital car parking charges are a tax on the sick.,504,307
We will invest £200 million to make parking at English hospitals free for patients and their visitors.,504,308
We think NHS managers should be subject to disciplinary oversight in the same way as doctors and nurses who are regulated by the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council.,504,310
"We will introduce a Licence to Manage as a statutory requirement to prevent incompetent, negligent or bullying managers being moved sideways or re-employed by the NHS as external consultants.",504,311
We will also abolish Monitor and the Care Quality Commission and place their inspectorate functions into the hands of county health boards made up of health and social care professionals elected locally by their peers.,301,312
"County health boards will have the power to inspect health services, conduct snap inspections and take evidence from whistleblowers.",301,313
"They will be charged with a statutory duty to investigate concerns flagged up by their local Healthwatch or local authority Health Scrutiny panels, so local democratic control and accountability is brought to healthcare decisions directly affecting our local communities.",301,314
"When short-sighted politicians are desperate for votes, they make appalling decisions.",305,316
Labours Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scandal is a case in point.,305,317
"By the time the £14 billion capital cost of NHS PFI contracts have run their course, the NHS will have been forced to pay out a total of £76 billion.",305,318
"UKIP will not continue to privatise the NHS by the back door, as both Labour and the Conservatives have done.",413,319
We will end the use of PFI contracts within the NHS.,413,320
Numerous EU Directives prevent medical institutions from operating in the best interests of patients.,110,322
"We will scrap at least two of them: the EU Clinical Trial Directive, which has led to a substantial drop in clinical research and threatened Britains position as a world-class leader in this field;",110,323
"and the EU Working Time Directive which, by limiting working and training time to 48 hours in any one week, prevents medics learning essential new skills, putting patient care at risk.",110,324
TTIP is a proposed EU/USA free trade agreement that is being negotiated in secret by the EU Trade Commission and other EU bureaucrats.,110,326
"There is growing concern that TTIP may compel us to put many of our public services up for sale to US companies, thereby privatising significant parts of our NHS.",413,327
"UKIP is committed to securing the exclusion of the NHS, by name, from TTIP.",413,328
"The level of public concern around TTIP makes it a good example of what can potentially go wrong while we remain in the EU and allow EU Commissioners to negotiate every single trade agreement on behalf of twenty-eight member states, including the UK, en bloc.",110,329
Fears of what TTIP might contain precisely illustrate why UKIP believes we should leave the EU and negotiate our own free trade agreements again.,110,330
"We find it astonishing that other political parties, while launching high-profile campaigns against TTIP, nevertheless remain committed to our EU membership.",110,331
Their hypocrisy is shameless.,110,332
The coalition cuts went deep.,504,334
"UKIP will increase social care funding by £1.2 billion each year, phasing in this increase over a two-year period, to bring investment back to 2010 levels and pay for the additional residential, nursing and home care services that are so desperately needed.",504,335
"According to Age UK, 900,000 older people between the ages of 65 and 89 have social care needs that are not met.",504,336
"Residential care, nursing care, home care, day care and equipment budgets have been cut.",504,337
"Meals on Wheels services have been scrapped in some areas, or frozen ready-meals have replaced freshly cooked hot food.",504,338
These cuts impact on the NHS: one million hospital bed days are lost every year when patients cannot be discharged because there is no after-care available for them.,504,339
Operations are cancelled for the same reason.,504,340
How we look after our older people and others who are vulnerable in society because of ill health is a mark of how civilised we are as a society.,606,341
It is scandalous that the current care system is failing those who most need our help.,606,342
We believe putting back the investment that was taken away by the current government is more than expedient: it is our duty.,606,343
The £1.2 billion UKIP will invest every year by the end of the next parliament will fund social care directly and ease the path through a change we want to make to the way the current system is financed.,504,344
"While local authorities manage social care, the NHS manages health.",504,346
"This makes for a complex, inefficient and fragmented approach.",504,347
"While attempts to integrate the two, while keeping funding and responsibilities separate, have been commendable, the common sense, long-term solution is simply to fully integrate health and social care.",504,348
"UKIP will bring health and social care together, under the control of the NHS.",504,349
"In 2010, the Commission on Funding of Care and Support, chaired by Andrew Dilnot, was tasked by Government with reviewing the funding system for care and support in England.",504,351
"It concluded that an individuals contribution to social care costs should be capped at £35,000.",504,352
"We agree in principle: easing the burden on the growing numbers of families who face ever-increasing elderly care costs is clearly desirable, if currently unaffordable.",504,353
"We propose a possible future solution: the establishment of a Sovereign Wealth Fund from any tax revenue received from shale oil and gas exploration, with investment returns ring-fenced to fully implement the Commissions recommendations.",504,354
"The viability of this proposal clearly depends on several unknowns, not least getting the go-ahead for shale exploration and unpredictable market forces, but we feel it is important to state this policy as an intention.",504,355
"Should fracking in the UK prove to be possible and profitable, we want to see the nations income from it spent on looking after older people.",504,356
"Establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund from the tax profits of fracking, and ring-fencing the income it generates for a social care fund, will  potentially release older people from the distress of having to sell their  homes to pay for care and give them and their families peace of mind.",504,357
UKIP believes the elderly and vulnerable must be treated with compassion and dignity.,504,359
We will: Introduce a legally-binding Dignity Code to improve standards of professional care,504,360
"Pledge to protect services such as day care, home care and Meals on Wheels",504,361
Abolish the practice of arranging home care visits in fifteen-minute windows,504,362
"Abolish the annual assessment process for continuing healthcare funding in respect of those suffering from degenerative, terminal illnesses",504,363
"Keep free bus passes,",504,364
"winter fuel allowances,",504,365
free TV licenses for the over 75s,504,366
"and free prescriptions and eye tests for the over-60s, without means testing.",504,367
"We will also fund a co-ordinating service for older people in every county, combining resources from across the NHS, social services, community agents and the voluntary sector.",504,368
No vulnerable person should feel isolated or alone and this service will be proactive in identifying and assisting those suffering from loneliness.,504,369
"Good home care starts with good home care workers, who provide a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.",701,371
Theirs is a difficult enough job to do at the best of times and long hours and low pay make an already challenging role even more onerous.,701,372
We cannot expect workers to give the best care if they themselves are not being cared for.,701,373
This is a serious issue UKIP will tackle head-on.,701,374
We will not allow the NHS or third parties under contract to employ home care workers on zero hour contracts of  any kind.,701,375
Neither will we allow them to end up being paid less than the minimum wage because they are expected to travel between appointments in their own time.,701,376
We will insist they are paid for the entire time they are on duty.,701,377
"We believe that as Britains largest employer, the NHS should set an example.",701,378
Pensions have changed considerably since 2010.,504,380
The state pension has been simplified to a single-tier.,504,381
The need to apply for pension credit (which often went unclaimed) has been removed.,504,382
"The triple lock now guarantees the state pension will increase each year by  the higher of inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent.",504,383
There is greater flexibility in how  personal pensions can be accessed.,504,384
These are all welcome reforms.,504,385
Raising the retirement age to 66 by 2020 and to 67 by 2028 is hugely unpopular.,504,386
"It has been especially tough for women, who until 2010 could retire at 60.",504,387
"Also, millions of people who can now withdraw unlimited amounts from their personal pension pot may not be well-informed enough to make the best onward investments, or avoid falling victim to scams.",504,388
"When you have looked forward to retirement, short-notice changes to the state pension age can wreck long-term plans.",504,390
UKIP will give pensioners some choice over the age at which they choose to retire.,504,391
"We will introduce a flexible state pension window, which will widen over time, so even when the state pension age increases to 69, pensioners will still be able to take a slightly lower weekly state pension from the age of 65.",504,392
Pensioners will know how much less they will be paid at the time they make their decision.,504,393
"At the moment, you can delay taking your state pension in return for a slightly higher amount, so UKIPs proposal merely extends the option in the other direction.",504,394
This proposal will be cost-neutral to the state over time.,504,395
"A flexible state pension window already works well in other countries, notably Italy, Norway, Sweden and Finland, so there is no reason why it will not work in the UK.",504,396
With greater freedom over personal pensions comes individual responsibility for retirement finance planning.,504,398
"Historically, people have had limited options of when to draw down funds from their personal plans.",504,399
"Most were forced to take out an annuity, paid out evenly, over the course of their retirement.",504,400
"Pensioners will now be making complex decisions about when and how much to take from their pension pots and, before doing so, they need expert advice to make sound, well-informed choices.",504,401
All pensioners get from the current government is 45 minutes of advice provided by the Pensions Advisory Service or Citizens Advice Bureau.,504,402
This is completely inadequate when potentially life-changing decisions are at stake.,504,403
UKIP will fund a higher standard of independent advice available to all pensioners.,504,404
"We will double the budget for guidance in 2015/16 from £30 million to £60 million,",504,405
and treble the 2016/17 budget from £10 million to £30 million.,504,406
"In consultation with bodies such as the Chartered Insurance Institute and the Personal Finance Society, we will develop a pensions advice and seminar programme that will help protect pensioners best interests and savings.",504,407
A further concern is that pensioners with limited financial experience may become the victims of mis-selling when they cash in their pension pots and have access to potentially large sums of money.,504,409
"To prevent mis-selling, UKIP will make it a criminal offence to cold call someone in respect of their pension arrangements.",605,410
This will not affect regulated advisors or pension schemes where there is already an existing relationship with a client.,504,411
"Rogue, unregulated operators must not be allowed to take advantage of pensioners while lining their own pockets.",605,412
"On 8th November 2014, the Government announced that war widows and widowers would receive a war widows pension for life, even after remarriage, with effect from April 2015.",504,414
"However, this change was not retrospective and is therefore manifestly unfair.",504,415
"We will give all war widows and widowers a war pension, regardless of when they may have remarried.",504,416
"Circumstances can conspire against any one of us to leave us unemployed, seriously ill and unable to work, perhaps even facing bankruptcy and homelessness.",504,418
"UKIP is fully committed to maintaining a strong and supportive safety net for those who fall on hard times, whether through any fault of their own or not.",504,419
"We want to see a welfare system that is fairer, simpler and less open to abuse.",504,420
"Our approach is one that firmly opposes the benefits lifestyle but also addresses the current welfare regime, which has produced unjust outcomes.",505,421
Our common sense approach to benefits includes: - Supporting a lower cap on benefits,505,422
Cracking down on benefit fraud,505,423
Ending welfare tourism with a five-year ban on benefits for migrants,505,424
Stopping child benefit being paid to children who dont live in the UK,505,425
Limiting child benefit to two children for new claimants.,505,426
The bedroom tax is clearly unfair and is not working.,504,428
Changes to the way housing benefit is paid are leading some tenants to fall into debt.,504,429
The Conservative threat to withdraw Housing Benefit from the under-25s may cause even more suffering.,504,430
UKIP will: Scrap the bedroom tax,504,431
Continue to pay Housing Benefit to young people under the age of 25,504,432
"Give tenants the right to request Housing Benefit is paid direct to their landlords, whatever benefit scheme they are on.",504,433
"UKIP is fully committed to protecting the rights of disabled people, as set out in Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.",201,435
"We wholly endorse the right of the disabled to access in-home, residential and community support services and we support their inclusion in our communities.",201,436
We also recognise that there will always be disabled people who are unable to work and we are committed to supporting them through a fair and fit-for-purpose welfare system.,504,437
"We will end unfair ATOS-style Work Capability Assessments and return assessments to GPs or appropriate specialist consultants, who have full access to patients medical records and are likely to know the patient.",504,438
We believe this makes them the best person to undertake assessments and we will ensure they are adequately funded and resourced to take on this task.,504,439
"We will also: Require GPs/specialists to notify the Department for Work and Pensions when they believe a patient is well enough to return to work, by issuing a fit note",504,440
"Remove tick-box and quota arrangements from sickness and disability assessments, thereby streamlining and speeding up the assessment processes",303,441
and continually respecting claimants throughout the process,504,442
"Millions give up work, or work reduced hours, to care for elderly or disabled relatives.",504,444
"In doing so, they make a huge contribution to society, although often at great personal and financial cost.",504,445
"We will: Increase Carers Allowance from £62.10 per week to match the higher level of Job Seekers Allowance, currently £73.10 per week, an extra £572 per year",504,446
Improve carers access to support by sharing information on benefit and social care entitlements and support groups across all public services.,504,447
It is deeply regrettable that there is increasing demand for foodbanks in 21st century Britain.,504,449
"If those who attend foodbanks are in such dire straits that they need food handouts, there is a high likelihood that they will also need additional support to deal with issues such as debt, family breakdown, addiction and poor physical or mental health.",504,450
Many will need employment or legal advice.,504,451
We will therefore contribute to the important work done by foodbanks and develop them into community advice centres for those most in need.,504,452
"UKIP will train and fund the cost of 800 advisers to work in 800 foodbanks, so the poorest in our society have free and easy access to timely help in their hour of need.",504,453
We will also exempt foodbanks and charity shops from charges imposed by local authorities to dispose of unwanted food waste and other goods.,403,454
They are not businesses in the sense most of us understand the term and therefore should not be expected to pay fees for waste disposal.,403,455
UKIP believes supporting children and families is a prerequisite for a strong and healthy society.,504,457
"Families are important, in all their diversity, and we want to help create a society in which they thrive and where childcare provision is affordable and accessible for all parents, whatever their socio-economic status.",504,458
"Good childcare benefits parents, helps child development and supports our economy.",504,459
"UKIPs vision for childcare is a system where parents, teachers, schools, nurseries, childrens centres, local authorities, childcare providers and businesses all work together to make provision as affordable, flexible, available and as high-quality as possible.",504,460
The policies of current and previous governments have been counterproductive in many ways: over-regulation has helped create an acute shortage of places and voucher systems have contributed to pushing up the cost of childcare.,504,461
"UK childcare costs are now the most expensive in Europe, and among the highest in the world.",504,462
Costs can be crippling for ordinary families.,504,463
What is  the point of having a childcare system that is so expensive it does not pay  to work?,504,464
"Children from socially deprived backgrounds are adversely affected because their applications for places are most likely to be turned down, especially if parents are unable to pay for top-ups such as meals, nappies and so on.",504,465
Childcare provision is also complex and fragmented.,504,466
Several government departments oversee different schemes providing help with childcare costs.,504,467
Parents may struggle to work out which type of childcare funding system will work best for them.,504,468
Those on modest incomes who work hard may find they fall through the gaps.,504,469
"Parents who are self-employed, agency workers, those on zero-hours contracts or commission are most likely to be affected, as any rise in income may prove punitive, depending on which childcare support scheme has been chosen.",504,470
"A simpler system, more responsive to families changing needs and with integrated sources of funding, must be initiated at the earliest opportunity,",504,471
"alongside proposals to reduce the cost of childcare and increase the number of childcare places, while giving parents more choice.",504,472
We will initiate a full review of childcare provision.,504,473
"UKIP will continue to fund the current childcare offer of fifteen hours a week of free childcare at a nursery, preschool, or for a childminder, for all three to four year olds,",504,475
and for all two-year olds whose parent are on certain benefits.,504,476
"We will also honour the current Governments commitment to providing a new tax-free childcare scheme, worth up to £2,000 for children under twelve.",504,477
"However, we will amend the voucher scheme in order to address the shortage of places and cut the cost to both parents and the state, by de-regulating childcare provision.",504,478
"At the moment, if parents want to claim their free childcare entitlement, they must place their child with an Ofsted-registered childminder.",504,479
"UKIP will remove this requirement and allow parents to use any third-party, non-related child carer they feel comfortable placing their child with, provided the care provided can be proven to be genuine.",504,480
"This is intended to encourage experienced parents whose own children have grown up, for instance, or who would like to combine looking after other peoples children alongside their own, to offer childcare.",504,481
"Our plans will also make it cost-effective for parents to hire a nanny if they have more than one young child, or enable parents to club together to hire a nanny.",504,482
"While parents should of course make their own enquiries as to the suitability of informal providers, in the same way they would check out a babysitter, we will require informal child carers to satisfy the following criteria to benefit from the voucher scheme: -",504,483
They must pass a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check,504,484
They must hold relevant household and public liability insurance,504,485
"They must not look after more than six children up to the age of eight (including any of their own children), of which a maximum of three can be under fives",504,486
A single childminder may only care for one child under one year old,504,487
The building from which they operate (unless it is the childs own home) must be notified to the local authority and be subject to spot checks.,504,488
"This combination of de-regulation, practical solutions and incentives will reduce childcare costs,",504,489
increase childcare availability,504,490
and make it easier for parents to find flexible childcare that works around their working hours and lifestyle.,504,491
UKIP will make consideration of the necessity to include nursery or creche provision an essential part of the planning process for large developments.,504,493
"We will also amend planning legislation to ensure planning applications for family housing developments of forty homes or more, without dedicated garden space for each unit, will be required to include a communal play area in each scheme.",504,494
We will also allow office space to be converted to nursery facilities under permitted development rights.,504,495
"We will also ask employers to pool nursery provisions for all families within the local community, where ever possible.",504,496
Tackling excessive regulation without compromising child safety is a priority.,504,497
"Nurseries are often small businesses and we would prefer owners to be focused on childcare, rather than drowning in paperwork.",504,498
"For parents of school-age children, extending the school day by offering wrap-around childcare will offer enormous benefits to working parents, for whom it is likely to be by far the most sensible and convenient childcare option.",504,500
"We will place a statutory duty on all primary schools to offer before and after-school care from 8am to 6pm during term time, with the option to extend this to all-day provision throughout the school holidays.",504,501
Sessions will include breakfast and healthy snacks.,504,502
"Sadly, anecdotal evidence suggests significant numbers of teachers are seeing pupils arrive at school hungry.",504,503
Schools can choose how they facilitate before and after-school care.,504,504
They can provide it themselves; partner with external childcare providers; or allow parents to club together.,504,505
"There will be no cost to the school, as parents will pay for the cost of childcare themselves or use the voucher scheme.",504,506
"Local authorities will be required to keep a register of child care providers willing to offer emergency childcare cover at short notice, during atypical hours, overnight, or at weekends.",504,508
"This will help families who need to access high quality care during unsocial hours, in an emergency, when they are called to a job interview at short notice, or when they are working away from home, for example.",504,509
"UKIP will reform the care system so the 68,000 children in care in the UK (including 3,600 under the age of one) can find stability through fostering and adoption in a faster, more efficient way.",504,511
"We will extend the provisions of the Children and Families Act 2014, which gives children in care the choice to stay with their foster families until they turn 21, to children in homes, so they too have the same opportunity.",504,512
UKIP wants fathers to be more involved in their childrens lives.,503,514
"To help prevent thousands of fathers losing contact with their children each year when couples break up, UKIP will legislate for an initial presumption of 50-50 shared parenting in child residency matters.",503,515
"Grandparents will also be given visiting rights, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Family Court that there is a good reason to withhold such rights.",503,516
"We will also review the Family Court system, with the intention of implementing independent lay oversight of Family Courts, to ensure that necessary confidentiality does not prevent proper scrutiny in this and all areas of Family Law.",303,517
"A misplaced sensitivity to issues of race and religion, combined with fear, has been shown to have stopped many investigations into the abuse of children.",504,519
There is also concern among the public at rising levels of forced adoptions.,504,520
Some of those charged with protecting children in care are letting serious cases of abuse and maltreatment slip through the net.,504,521
Our childrens wellbeing lags behind many of our European neighbours and we are seeing alarming rates of self-harm and poor mental health.,504,522
"UKIP is committed to bringing forward a full, open review of all childcare and child protection services in Britain, with a view to initiating wholesale reform of a system that is clearly failing.",504,523
"Our children deserve better and UKIP will investigate failings without fear or favour to deliver a safer, brighter, fairer future for our children.",504,524
UKIPs vision for British education is of a world-renowned system;,601,526
"a system designed to allow young people to perform to the best of their ability, regardless of background, gender, race, wealth or class.",503,527
It is morally wrong that five independent fee-paying schools should send more students to Oxbridge than the worst performing two thousand secondary schools combined,503,528
and that more students from the state sector attended Oxbridge in the 1960s than do so now.,503,529
We believe it is the duty of the state to ensure high quality education is provided for all.,506,530
"To achieve this, we will build our education policy upon three key principles: -",506,531
1.  Education must be responsive to individual needs,506,532
"Children have widely different aptitudes and capabilities and, crucially, they develop at different rates.",506,533
Our school system and our whole approach to education should be more flexible than it is now.,506,534
2.  Good teachers are paramount The quality of education is almost entirely dependent on the quality of teaching.,506,535
We need the best people to choose to teach and we need to keep them teaching.,506,536
"To achieve this, we must ensure not only that teachers are well-prepared for a teaching career, but also that they have a high status in society and feel valued.",506,537
3.  The importance of primary education,506,538
"A childs first experience of education is vitally important, as this is when the pattern for learning is laid down and when literacy and good social skills are established.",506,539
Too many teachers are working excessive hours and struggling to find an acceptable work-life balance.,506,541
"We do not want stressed, overworked teachers in our classrooms.",506,542
Their workloads must be eased.,506,543
"We will decrease the amount of paperwork teachers deal with, such as overly detailed individual lesson plans, data collection, excessive internal assessments and dialogue-based marking schemes.",506,544
"The plethora of centralised targets will be streamlined and lesson observations limited to a maximum of one each term, except when there are concerns about teaching performance that appraisal processes have been unable to address.",506,545
"Enforcing the current restriction on class sizes to thirty pupils and aiming to reduce this to twenty-five pupils over time, will further ease teacher workloads  not least when it comes to marking -",506,546
as well as ease parental concerns about large class sizes.,506,547
"We will scrap teachers performance-related pay, which the NUT describes as having increased bureaucracy and working hours and does not adequately reflect teaching ability.",506,548
"UKIP will abolish Key Stage 1 SATs, set at the age of seven, as these tests have destructive, unintended consequences:",506,550
"they encourage teaching to the test,",506,551
"they narrow the curriculum and,",506,552
"often, they put pressure on teachers to concentrate disproportionate resources and time on borderline pupils.",506,553
"Worst of all, these tests create anxiety for everyone  children, teachers, parents, school governors  at exactly the time when children should be learning to learn, to enjoy the experience and to think of school as a fun and rewarding place to be.",506,554
"To increase the uptake of science learning at secondary level, we will follow the recommendations of the Campaign for Science and Engineering and require every primary school to nominate (and train, if necessary) a science leader to inspire and equip the next generation.",506,555
This role will also help to address the gender imbalance in the scientific subjects.,503,556
"We support age-appropriate sex and relationship education at secondary level, but not for primary school children.",506,558
"There is a world of difference between teaching young children about online safety or telling them no one else is allowed to touch the private parts of their body, which is a sensible way to help prevent and encourage reporting of abuse and going into too much detail.",506,559
"The latter risks sexualising childhood, causing confusion and anxiety, and encouraging experimentation.",506,560
"We will also rule that all parents must be made fully aware of the sex education teaching materials being used, before their children see it,",506,561
and we will continue to respect their right to withdraw children from sex-education classes if they wish.,506,562
"UKIP will push for a range of different types of school, including grammar, vocational, technical and specialist secondary schools within a geographical area.",506,564
"This will make our secondary school system more responsive to the differing aptitudes, capabilities and speed of development of our children.",506,565
"In stark contrast to the other main parties, who have persistently campaigned against them, UKIP supports grammar schools.",506,567
Demand for places far outstrips supply and UKIP will give existing secondary schools the opportunity to become grammar schools.,506,568
Many pupils learn best in a rigorous academic environment and the system can improve social mobility for able children from poorer backgrounds.,506,569
"We want to foster academic education among bright poorer students still further,",506,570
"and ultimately, UKIP wants to see a grammar school in every town.",506,571
"We recognise that the old 11+ selective system was not perfect, so we will ensure attendance is not based on a onetime fixed test and introduce transfer examinations taken later at ages 12, 13 and 16, to pick up pupils who develop in an academic direction, but at a slightly slower pace.",506,572
"As well as allowing existing schools to become grammar schools, we will allow other establishments to become vocational schools or colleges similar to those promoted in Germany and The Netherlands, so pupils develop practical skills.",506,574
"Further, by linking vocational schools and colleges with industry, we will introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship qualification instead of four non-core GCSEs.",506,575
"Students can then continue their apprenticeships past the age of 16, working with certified professionals qualified to grade their progress.",506,576
"Reintroduce the Intermediate tier at GCSE Mathematics, to ensure Foundation and Intermediate tiers are skills-based and that the Higher tier is a rigorous preparation for A Level",506,578
"Abolish the AS level exam as a stepping stone to a full A level, while retaining it as a standalone qualification in its own right for those who choose to approach it as such.",506,579
"If young students want to take a full A level, they may as well start the essential in-depth learning immediately and escape the stressful treadmill of continuous examinations from 16 onwards.",506,580
This move has the additional advantage of releasing an extra six weeks of lessons during the summer term between GCSEs and A levels,506,581
"Make First Aid training a statutory part of Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) in the national curriculum.",506,582
We will learn from the French system where pupils can obtain a Basic Life-Saving Diploma at the end of secondary school.,506,583
This will include instruction in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for all secondary school pupils,506,584
"Fund all secondary schools according to a single formula, taking into account Special Educational Needs, to ensure underfunding such as that for secondary moderns in the 1950s can never be repeated.",506,585
The policy of closing special schools will be reversed.,506,587
Every child is unique and the needs of each child should come first.,506,588
"Those who learn better in a tailored, non-mainstream environment should have the opportunity to do so.",506,589
"Ofsted inspections will be streamlined to focus on the quality of teaching, learning and the overall wellbeing of children, rather than paperwork, school policies or tick-box targets.",506,591
"Inspections will be shorter, classroom-orientated, and more transparent.",506,592
"We will continue to monitor British values, but with a view towards combatting extremism and radicalisation, rather than criticising widely-held Judeo-Christian beliefs.",603,593
Teachers with at least fifteen years successful classroom experience will be prioritised when Ofsted inspectors are recruited:,506,594
teachers are right to question whether they should be judged by those who have less classroom experience than themselves.,506,595
Schools will be subject to additional investigations by Ofsted if 25 per cent of parents or governors present a petition to the Department for Education.,506,596
An independent body will hear complaints about an Ofsted inspection.,506,597
We will remove Ofsteds right to investigate itself.,506,598
Previous government policies of pursuing higher education targets and introducing tuition fees have had a crippling effect on our young peoples finances and job prospects.,506,600
"The average student now leaves university with a debt of £44,000, yet students are less likely to find a graduate-level job than ever before.",506,601
"47 per cent of recent graduates were under-employed in 2013, as opposed to just 37 per cent in 2001.",506,602
This marks a 27 per cent increase in the inability of graduates to get a job utilising or requiring their degree qualification.,506,603
The taxpayer fares little better: 45 per cent of all student loans have to be written-off.,506,604
"To combat this growing problem, UKIP will drop the arbitrary 50 per cent target for school leavers going to university.",506,605
We will not increase the current level of undergraduate courses until we can be sure there are sufficient vacancies in the economy to provide at least two-thirds of students with skilled graduate jobs.,506,606
"We will also encourage students to choose careers that will help fill the current skills gap, to both benefit Britain and set them on the path to a solid, prosperous career.",506,607
"UK students taking approved degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM), mainly at universities funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, will not have to repay their tuition fees.",506,608
"This is on condition that they work in their discipline and pay tax in the UK for at least five years, after they complete their degrees.",506,609
"Accordingly, UKIP will adjust the number of STEMM subjects funded to allow for a greater uptake of these subjects.",506,610
"We are currently obliged to give tuition fee loans to EEA students as a condition of our EU membership, but as of March 2013, only 11 per cent of EU domiciled students were making any repayments.",110,612
"As student loans include a huge subsidy from the taxpayer and because repayment rates are so low, we will not give tuition fee loans to EEA students when we leave the EU.",110,613
They will of course be welcome to apply for places at UK universities as self-supporting international students.,110,614
"UKIP supports the right of parents to home-school their children, if they choose to do.",503,616
"We will support and fund free schools, provided they are open to the whole local community,",503,617
uphold British values,601,618
and do not discriminate against any section of society.,503,619
UKIP is the only party to recognise that a house needs to be built every seven minutes to meet demand.,403,622
"The housing shortage is leading to higher rents, less stable tenancies, and rising homelessness.",403,623
This is completely unsustainable.,403,624
There is a dire shortage of affordable housing in Britain.,403,625
Many of those who would like to own their own home are simply unable to even contemplate it.,403,626
They are locked out of home ownership.,403,627
Social housing waiting lists get longer and longer.,403,628
"The Thatcher era saw a dramatic extension in home ownership, but with a corresponding decline in social housing, as proceeds from the Right to Buy initiative were not reinvested back into community housing.",403,629
"Only 23 per cent of properties are deemed affordable nationally, but the situation is even worse in the countryside, where only 5 per cent of rural properties are affordable and social housing is more difficult to find.",403,630
"Yet no-one wants to see our green fields concreted over, or the beauty of our rural landscape destroyed.",416,631
"UKIP will introduce policies to incentivise the creation of more affordable housing,",402,632
while protecting rural communities and preserving our precious countryside.,501,633
"Housing charity Shelter reports there are 279,000 privately-owned long-term empty homes in England alone, while other bodies, such as the Empty Homes Agency, put the figure much higher still.",403,635
The most obvious way to create new homes is by bringing these empty homes back into use.,403,636
We will place a statutory duty on local authorities to:,403,637
Include a commitment to bringing empty properties back into use within their broader housing and planning strategies,403,638
"Charge those whose homes are empty for more than two years 50 per cent more than the applicable rate of council tax,",403,639
with exceptions for owners who are in HM Armed Forces.,503,640
"It would be possible to build up to 2.5 million houses on brownfield sites, if developers were less reluctant to take advantage of this rich source of potential housing land.",402,642
Problems with remediation of derelict land that has had a previous use and may have contamination issues to address can be off-putting to potential developers.,402,643
This is  despite the fact technology to  clean up sites and make them fit for new development is now readily available.,402,644
We will take steps to remove the barriers to brownfield builds with the aim of building one million homes on brownfield sites by 2025 to address the current housing shortage.,402,645
UKIP will require the Environment Agency to compile a National Brownfield Sites Register and provide a remediation assessment where appropriate.,402,646
The following financial incentives will be offered to encourage developers to build on brownfield sites:,402,647
"Grants of up to £10,000 per unit will be available to developers to carry out essential remediation work.",402,648
"Properties built on registered brownfield sites will be exempt from stamp duty on first sale, up to the £250,000 threshold.",402,649
A grant to cover the cost of indemnity insurance will also be available to developers of decontaminated land.,402,650
"To further incentivise brownfield development, local authorities will be allowed to keep the New Homes Bonus beyond six years on brownfield sites.",402,651
We will increase the supply of affordable housing by:,402,653
Identifying long-term dormant land held by central and local government so it can be released for affordable developments,402,654
Relax planning regulations for the conversion of off-high road commercial and office space and other existing buildings to affordable residential use.,402,655
"While these measures will help address the housing shortage, we cannot just build our way out of the housing crisis.",403,656
Our housing policy needs to be seen within a wider context of addressing the issue of supply and demand.,403,657
Controlling the numbers of new migrants coming to Britain is one important part of the housing jigsaw.,406,658
There are no clear national statistics to tell us how many people are homeless in the UK.,503,660
"To give an indication of the scale of the problem, the Autumn 2014 total of rough sleeping counts and estimates in England was 2,744, according to the government.",503,661
This was an increase of 14 per cent on 2013 figures.,503,662
"Meanwhile, 112,070 people declared themselves homeless in England in 2013/4.",503,663
The scale of homelessness in 2015 is morally reprehensible and UKIP will seek to eliminate this national scandal.,503,664
"Tackling homelessness starts with knowing who and where homeless people are, so they can be offered housing and other life opportunities.",504,665
We will establish a National Homeless Register to make it easier for those of no fixed abode to claim welfare entitlements;,504,666
get access to medical and dental services;,504,667
"and enable support services to identify those at risk of physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",504,668
UKIP will encourage moves by local authorities to prioritise people with strong local connections when making housing allocations.,601,670
We will relieve pressure on social housing waiting lists by preventing foreign nationals from obtaining access to social housing until they have lived here and paid UK Tax and National Insurance for a minimum of five years.,601,671
This restriction will not apply to foreign nationals with current social housing tenancies.,503,672
UKIP supports the principle of extending home ownership and giving people the right to own the homes they may have lived in for generations as social housing tenants.,503,674
"We will plough 100 per cent of all revenue from Right to Buy sales, after essential costs have been paid back, into new community housing.",504,675
"We will not allow non-British nationals access to the Right to Buy or Help to Buy schemes, unless they have served in Her Majestys Armed Forces.",601,676
"Given that Britains social housing stock is so massively oversubscribed, we do not believe it is either sensible or fair to give foreign nationals the opportunity to obtain social housing stock, buy their home at a discount and then sell it for an untaxed profit before moving back abroad.",601,677
"All local authorities, social landlords and housing associations will be required to register the nationality of their tenants in order to ensure this policy works in practice.",601,678
"In the same way, only British citizens will be permitted to access Help to Buy schemes.",601,679
UKIP will not allow new housing to strip our nation of prime agricultural land.,703,681
"This must be kept for its primary purpose, creating a secure food supply for Britain and for export.",703,682
Neither will we allow the countryside to be swamped by over-development:,416,683
we believe strongly that our countryside must be preserved so it can be enjoyed by future generations.,501,684
We will replace the current National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) and introduce fresh national planning guidelines that will prioritise brownfield sites for new housing and genuinely protect the green belt,416,685
The NPPF as it stands is disastrous for the environment.,416,686
It has given developers the green light to build just about anywhere and seriously restricts the ability of local authorities to refuse planning permission for inappropriate developments.,416,687
"The Tories promised localism, in their 2010 Manifesto, saying they would give more power to local people but, in reality, their planning policies have stripped powers away from communities.",301,688
UKIP genuinely supports local communities having a greater say over what happens in their locality and we will:,301,689
Free local authorities from government-imposed minimum housing numbers,301,690
"Reverse current policies of facilitating large-scale rural residential developments,",416,691
Promote smaller 6-12 unit developments in rural areas to extend existing villages,416,692
Encourage local authorities to require a proportion of self-build plots to be provided in all large developments,416,693
"Allow large-scale developments to be overturned by a binding local referendum triggered by the signatures of 5 per cent of electors within a planning authority area, collected within three months",416,694
Reduce the cost and bureaucracy of planning applications by merging Planning and Building Control departments in local authorities.,303,695
"UKIP will change the law to allow mortgages to become inheritable, as they are in other countries.",403,697
This will allow lenders to resume lending to older borrowers.,403,698
UKIP will not introduce any form of Mansion Tax.,403,699
Ours is a nation always on the move.,411,701
"Whether our daily journey takes us on the school run or on a long, cross-country haul, everyone needs a reliable, cost-efficient transport network.",411,702
We do not need extortionate vanity projects or excessive regulations and motorists should not feel as if they are being used as cash cows to boost national or local government funds.,411,703
"In October 2013, Lord Mandelson, speaking in the House of Lords about the Labour governments decision to instigate the HS2 high-speed rail-link confessed that: It was a political trophy project justified on flimsy evidence.",416,705
HS2 is running out of control.,416,706
UKIP will stop this flawed vanity scheme in its tracks.,416,707
"The estimated cost is already £50 billion and HS2 Ltd is planning to spend over £800m in 2015/2016, before the project even gets the final go-ahead.",416,708
The Governments own estimates show the cost will never be recouped.,416,709
HS2 will blight thousands of homes and wreak irreparable environmental damage across large tracts of central England.,416,710
"The argument that HS2 is needed to provide extra capacity has just weeks ago been questioned by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which concluded that: the Government has not made a convincing case for why this particular project should go ahead.",416,711
There is barely any evidence that HS2 will reduce the North-South divide:,416,712
the north would get much quicker and higher benefit from investment in the infrastructure between northern towns and cities.,416,713
"HS2 is an unaffordable white elephant and, given other, far more pressing calls on public expenditure, such as the NHS, social care and defence, not to mention the need to reduce the deficit, it must face the axe.",416,714
The final report of the Davies Commission into airport capacity and connectivity in the UK will be published later this year.,411,716
UKIP will consider its recommendations and then take a position on the basis of what we genuinely believe to be in the long-term best interests of the country.,411,717
"However, we firmly believe that part of the solution to address the lack of airport capacity in the South East is to re-open Manston Airport.",411,718
Manston is ideally placed to take low-cost airlines and freight-only aircraft;,411,719
it is close to the railway network;,411,720
enjoys good connections to Ashford International;,411,721
will release additional capacity in the region;,411,722
and take pressure off other airports.,411,723
"UKIP will only allow installation of speed cameras when they can be used as a deterrent at accident black spots, near schools and in residential areas where there are specific potential dangers.",416,725
We will not permit speed cameras to be used as revenue-raisers for local authorities.,416,726
We will remove road tolls where possible and let existing contracts on running road tolls expire.,403,728
Motorists are already taxed highly enough through fuel and vehicle taxes.,403,729
UKIP opposes pay-as-you-go road charging schemes and attempts to introduce them by stealth.,110,731
"From October 2015, the EU will require all new cars to be fitted with the eCall system.",110,732
"Ostensibly a road safety measure, this system tracks vehicles using GPS and reports back to a central database.",110,733
"This capability would enable introduction of a Europe-wide road pricing system, on a miles travelled basis, which the EU Transport Commissioner is keen to introduce.",110,734
We will scrap mandatory fitments of eCall and allow owners who already have eCall installed to disable it on their vehicles.,110,735
"The Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (DCPC) is an expensive second-tier requirement, which is causing job losses, because of the added administration and expense to hauliers.",110,737
We will scrap the DCPC for professionally licensed drivers.,110,738
"This levy currently applies to HGV vehicles registered both in the UK and other EU countries, to comply with various EU directives.",110,740
"After leaving the EU the levy would cease to apply to UK vehicles, but the Vehicle Excise Duty on UK vehicles would be adjusted by the equivalent amount to make this aspect of the change revenue neutral for both UK hauliers and the government.",110,741
The current levy tariff will then be doubled to a maximum of £2000 per annum and only apply to foreign registered HGVs.,406,742
"This change will help UK hauliers to compete with European hauliers entering the UK, loaded with cheaper fuel bought on the Continent.",406,743
It will achieve exactly the same effect as UKIPs original Britdisc proposal.,406,744
"To help protect the enduring legacy of the motor industry and our classic and historic vehicles, UKIP will exempt vehicles over 25 years old from Vehicle Excise Duty.",408,746
"The three old parties collude to reinforce failing energy policies that will do nothing to reduce global emissions, but which will bring hardship to British families.",416,748
Their green agenda does not make them friends of the earth;  it makes them enemies of the people.,416,749
"While our major global competitors - the USA, China, India - are switching to low-cost fossil fuels, we are forced to close perfectly good coal-fired power stations to meet unattainable targets for renewable capacity.",110,750
"If we carry on like this, the lights are likely to go out.",110,751
"Why? Because the 2008 Climate Change Act, an Act rooted in EU folly, drives up costs, undermines competitiveness and hits jobs and growth.",110,752
"Dubbed the most expensive piece of legislation in British history, the governments own figures put the cost of the Act at £18 billion a year over 40 years, or £720 billion between 2010 and 2050.",110,753
The Climate Change Act is doing untold damage.,110,754
UKIP will repeal it.,110,755
We will also scrap the Large Combustion Plant Directive and stop the EUs planned Medium Combustion Plant Directive.,110,756
"Both attempt to close down secure, reliable and economical electricity generation and replace it with expensive, intermittent, unreliable renewables.",416,757
We will encourage the re-development of British power stations and industrial units providing on-site power generation.,416,758
"To deliver secure, affordable energy supplies, we support a diverse energy market based on coal, nuclear, shale gas, conventional gas, oil, solar and hydro, as well as other renewables where these can be delivered at competitive prices.",416,759
"UKIP supports the development of shale gas, provided safeguards are in place to protect local communities and the environment.",402,761
Community Infrastructure Levy income from shale gas operations will be earmarked for lower Council Taxes or local community projects.,402,762
"No energy extraction technology is perfectly safe, but shale gas operations in the USA for instance, where tens of thousands of shale wells have been drilled and fracked over five decades, have proved remarkably unproblematic, especially so by comparison to other methods of energy extraction.",416,763
What is clearly unsafe is the UKs over-dependence on imports from politically unstable countries.,416,764
"In the interests of energy security alone, the prospect of home-grown shale gas is an enormous opportunity it would be irresponsible to ignore.",416,765
We will levy Petroleum Revenue Tax (currently 50 per cent) on any shale profits and invest the income into a Sovereign Wealth Fund.,402,766
"Norway takes this approach, with great success.",402,767
"UKIP supports and will invest in renewables, where they can deliver electricity at competitive prices.",416,769
"At the moment, the only major renewable technology that meets this test for affordability is hydro,",416,770
"so we will withdraw taxpayer and consumer subsidies for new wind turbines and solar photovoltaic arrays, while respecting existing contractual arrangements.",401,771
Wind power is hopelessly inefficient and wind farms rely heavily on reserve back-up from conventional power sources.,416,772
"They have blighted landscapes and put money into the pockets of wealthy landowners and investors, while pushing up bills for the rest of us.",416,773
The British coal industry once employed one million miners.,701,775
"Now, all three remaining deep coal mines in Britain are set to close by 2016, at a cost of 2,000 jobs, despite having many years of productive life left and regardless of our continuing need for coal.",402,776
30 per cent of our electricity is still produced from coal and we will be dependent on fossil fuels for many more years to come.,402,777
"If we are to have energy security and cheap, plentiful, reliable sources of energy, coal must be part of the solution.",402,778
"Bearing this in mind, UKIP will: Set up a commission to investigate ways to assist and rejuvenate the coal industry",402,779
"Seek to secure the survival and expansion of our indigenous coal industry in the form of deep, opencast and drift mining",402,780
"Drop all subsidies for wind and solar power, to ensure a level playing field for coal",403,781
Discontinue the carbon floor tax on the basis that production for coal fired power stations is combined with carbon capture and storage,403,782
"Halt the decline of coal power stations and seek private funding to develop new, efficient plants.",402,783
"In 2014, the government forced energy companies to add nearly £3.2 billion onto energy bills to finance their energy and climate change policies:",401,785
"that will have doubled to a staggering £9.8 billion by 2020, amounting to an extra £197 going onto our average domestic fuel bills.",401,786
UKIP will abolish green taxes and levies,401,787
"and withdraw from the EUs Emissions Trading Scheme,",110,788
reducing fuel bills and enhancing industrial competitiveness at a stroke.,401,789
"We will also make the way you pay your bill fairer, by stopping energy companies charging extra for customers who use prepayment meters, who do not pay by direct debit, or who require paper billing.",403,790
Being in the European Union is damaging the prospects for British workers.,110,792
"Uncontrolled mass immigration has driven down wages and for many jobs, the minimum wage is now the maximum wage.",110,793
"Meanwhile, fewer new jobs are being created because of excess EU regulations.",110,794
British workers will fare much better when we are out of the EU.,110,795
"In 2007, the Peugeot factory in Ryton, Coventry, closed and moved production to Slovakia.",110,796
"This cost 2,300 jobs.",110,797
"The EU pumped £78 million in subsidies into the new factory, while Brussels sat on a request for a UK subsidy of just £14 million, for two years.",110,798
"Prime Minister Tony Blair claimed the closure was the inevitable casualty of globalisation, but in fact the EU had made a conscious choice to boost the economy of Slovakia, at the expense of the UK.",110,799
"In 2012, Ford moved transit van production to non-EU Turkey with the help of an £80 million loan from the European Investment Bank.",110,800
500 jobs were lost in Southampton and 750 in Dagenham.,110,801
The sale of Royal Mail in 2013 and subsequent post office closures where both driven by the EU Postal Services Directive.,110,802
"1,300 Jobs have reportedly been lost.",110,803
These are just three examples of how interference from the EU leads to British job losses.,110,804
"British workers are suffering: Eurostat, the EUs own data service, revealed last year that EU migrants are more likely to be in work in Britain than Britons themselves.",110,805
"If we add to this the downward pressure on wages that has resulted from mass immigration, it is clear remaining in the EU is not favourable to British workers.",110,806
"By leaving the EU and restricting immigration through the use of an Australian-style points based system, we will give back some hope to British workers for a brighter future.",110,807
"UKIP will: Restrict  access  to  EURES,  the  EU-wide  jobs  portal  that  has become the go-to source for employers looking for cheap labour from overseas",110,808
"End  the  availability  of  EU  relocation  grants  of  up  to  1,000 for migrants to come and work in Britain",110,809
Allow  British  businesses  to  choose  to  employ  British  citizens first.,601,810
Enforce  the  minimum  wage,412,811
and  reverse  the  Government cuts in the number of minimum wage inspectors in both England and Wales,412,812
"Leaving the EU will not mean workers employment rights will be removed, simply that they will be adopted into UK law.",201,814
"Some EU directives, such as the Working Time Directive, need amending because they actively restrict the British work ethos and therefore our economy,",110,815
but UKIP will protect workers rights.,201,816
"The use of zero-hours contracts proliferated following the imposition of the EUs Temporary Agency Workers Directive, which demanded agency workers were given the same workplace rights as employees.",110,818
Zero-hours contracts enabled businesses to escape this edict.,110,819
"EU legislation, intended to benefit temporary workers, in fact ended up penalising them.",110,820
"Because UKIP recognises that zero-hours contracts suit many people, we will not ban them.",701,821
"We do, however, take a very dim view of their abuse and will introduce a legally binding Code of Conduct stipulating the following:",701,822
"Businesses  hiring  50  people  or  more  must  give  workers  on zero-hours contracts either a full or part-time secure contract after one year, if the workers involved request it",701,823
There  must  be  no  exclusivity  clauses  in  any  zero-hours  contract.,701,824
"To prevent people from working elsewhere when they have no guarantee of regular work, will be banned",701,825
Workers  on  zero-hours  contracts  must  be  given  at  least  twelve hours advance notice of work.,701,826
"Once notice has been given, they must be paid for the work, regardless of whether or not they are actually needed.",701,827
"Employers will not be permitted to expect a worker to turn up for work, only to be turned away again, when no work is available.",701,828
"Finally, a word on the pernicious myth that leaving the EU will cost three million British jobs.",110,830
"This myth grew out of a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) in 2000, which concluded that 2.7 million jobs were directly related to our trade with the EU and another 500,000 were indirectly linked.",110,831
"The report went on to say that: there is no a priori reason to suppose that many of these [jobs], if any, would be lost permanently if Britain were to leave the EU.",110,832
"The report was nevertheless spun by the pro-EU lobby, which tried to suggest jobs linked to EU trade, meant jobs were dependent on EU membership.",110,833
"The Director of NIESR repudiated their claims, describing their efforts as a wilful distortion of the facts.",110,834
"Sadly, unscrupulous politicians, fully aware of the truth of the matter, still attempt to deceive.",110,835
The jobs of British people - and the jobs of the five million Europeans who work here  are not dependent on EU membership and will be safe when we leave the EU.,110,836
"To say otherwise is, quite simply, dishonest.",110,837
"If you run a small business, then UKIP is the party for you.",403,839
We will do everything we can to help you be competitive in Britain and the global market.,403,840
"At the start of last year, there were an estimated 5.2 million small businesses in the UK, together employing over 12 million people and having a combined turnover of £1.2 trillion.",403,841
We find our greatest innovators and entrepreneurs within our small businesses.,403,842
The businesses they start and grow will take us out of the economic turmoil weve suffered in recent years and back into the black.,403,843
"Yet, too often, our small businesses are not supported.",403,844
They struggle to get finance to set up or expand their businesses.,403,845
"Larger companies who dont pay invoices on time, damage their cash flow.",403,846
Business rates can be prohibitively high.,403,847
"Excessive regulations stream out of Brussels, adding huge administrative and financial burdens to the challenges already faced by small businesses.",110,848
All this must stop.,403,849
"Business rates as a tax are a great burden on business and especially so on small businesses, where they represent a disproportionately high fixed cost.",402,851
"The Small Business Rate Relief currently only applies up to a rateable value of £12,000, meaning many small and medium-sized businesses receive no relief at all.",402,852
UKIP recognises this often rapidly-growing sector needs much greater support and we will change the,402,853
Small Business Rate Relief as follows:,402,854
"If  a  business  has  only  one  property  and  the  rateable  value is less than £50,000, the business will get 20 per cent rate relief",402,855
"If   the  business  has  more  than  one  property,  the  20  per cent rate relief will still apply, provided the total rateable value of all properties is less than £50,000",402,856
Other  existing  business  rate  reliefs  will  not  be  affected and will apply where the relief provided under those schemes is greater than 20 per cent,402,857
"Almost  90  per  cent  of  business  properties,  over   1.5 million in total, have a rateable value of less than £50,000, so are potentially eligible for this 20 per cent discount.",402,858
"According to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, more than £20 billion is locked up at any one time in delayed late payments from large companies (defined as a company with over 250 employees) to small suppliers of goods and services.",403,860
Small businesses find cash-flow tough enough in the current economic climate.,403,861
The last thing they need is to be bullied into providing interest-free loans to their customers.,403,862
It is not acceptable for big businesses to exploit smaller firms by deliberately delaying payments and UKIP will take firm action to stop this practice.,403,863
"Existing regulations are of little practical use: small businesses are reluctant to charge interest to customers and legal proceedings are expensive, time consuming and hardly an effective way to develop business relationships.",403,864
"UKIP will introduce a scheme whereby small businesses will provide evidence of repeated late payments, beyond agreed terms, together with evidence that timely requests for payments have been made, to HM Revenue and Customs.",403,865
Based on the evidence - particularly if there are multiple complaints about the same company -HMRC can then carry out an inspection of that companys records.,403,866
The identity of the complainant company will remain confidential.,403,867
"If the large company is found to be systematically exceeding its contractual terms of payment with small businesses, a sanction of significant fines, proportionate to the extent of the abuse of terms, will be levied.",403,868
Fines would escalate for repeat offenders and be noted in the offending companys statutory accounts.,403,869
"UKIP will also end a growing practice whereby large companies extend their payment terms to small companies, by arranging for their supplier to take out a bank loan to facilitate their demands.",403,870
"Despite schemes such as Funding for Lending and the Finance Guarantee, small businesses still find it difficult to secure funding in the current economic climate.",402,872
"While banks do of course have to consider risk, the lack of funding for small businesses will remain a drag on growth.",402,873
They are understandably fearful of bad debts.,402,875
"To address both this issues, UKIP will pilot a scheme to improve access to trade credit insurance to small businesses.",402,876
"This insurance already exists in the market, but can prove restrictive for smaller companies, especially in certain business sectors.",402,877
"Under our scheme, existing credit insurance providers will assess risk as they do now, independent of government involvement, but government would back a portion of the risk to enable cover to be provided more widely.",402,878
"The security this policy provides will give small businesses the confidence to expand trade, while enhancing the attractiveness of their loan book as a more secure asset against which banks can lend them money.",402,879
"If successful, this pilot will be rolled out nationally.",402,880
Businesses in our town centres  and shops in particular - have suffered as a result of the dramatic increase in out-of-town trading estates and supermarkets.,403,882
"UKIP believes our town centres should be vibrant and profitable and that means encouraging locals, visitors and tourists into town, by removing barriers that act as a disincentive, such as expensive or restricted parking.",403,883
"We will push every local authority in the country to offer at least  30 minutes free parking in town centres, high streets and shopping parades, to encourage shoppers into our town centres and boost local business.",403,884
Massive over-regulation by the European Union impacts disproportionately on smaller businesses.,110,886
"Fewer than one in ten British businesses trade with the EU, yet 100 per cent of them must comply with thousands of EU laws on employment, waste management, environmental regulations, product registration, health and safety and so on.",110,887
This burden can be overwhelming for small firms.,110,888
"A report by Business for Britain concluded that 3,580 new laws passed between 11 May 2010 and 1 October 2013 affected British business, with legislation running to over 13 million words.",110,889
"The EUs most costly regulations cost Britain an estimated £27.4 billion a year, according to 2013 research by think-tank Open Europe.",110,890
The Federation of Small Business says 61 per cent of small companies cite the regulatory burden as a significant factor when closing or downsizing.,110,891
UKIP will repeal EU Regulations and Directives that stifle business growth,110,892
We will also allow traders to sell in whatever quantities or measures they like.,110,893
Only UKIP will get us out of the EU and release enterprise from the strangulation excessive regulation.,110,894
"UKIP will make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses with 250 employees or less to tender for public sector contracts, by removing the necessity to demonstrate compliance in areas irrelevant to the job being tendered for.",403,896
This will benefit smaller companies and cut costs to the taxpayer.,403,897
UKIPs support for small businesses can be seen in many other policy areas too.,403,899
"For instance, small businesses will also get a boost from our policies to: Allow  young  people  to  start  an  apprenticeship  in  place  of  four  non-core subjects at GSCE level",403,900
"Abolish  tuition  fees  for  those  studying  science,  technology,  engineering, maths and medicine",403,901
Allow  employers  to  prioritise  British  citizens  for  jobs,403,902
Maintain  suitable  levels  of  immigration  to  fill  the  skills  gap,403,903
Cut  fuel  bills  through  the  abolition  of  green  levies  to  cut   business costs.,403,904
"UKIP believes in Britains small businesses, in its entrepreneurs, in its teams of sole traders, freelancers  and self-starters and will back them whenever  and however we can.",402,905
Farmers like myself have everything to gain by leaving the EU.,110,907
"UKIP has sound policies that will put British farmers first, promote high standards in animal husbandry and help secure a vibrant, thriving agriculture sector for Britain",703,908
"Outside the EU, free of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and excessive regulations,",110,909
"we will be able to introduce fairer, simpler ways to support farmers.",703,910
"For every £1 British agriculture receives from the CAP, the British taxpayer has already contributed £2, so we can easily continue to subsidise farmers after leaving the EU.",703,911
"We can also redistribute payments away from wealthy landowners and large, often intensively farmed holdings, in favour of smaller food producers and family farms.",703,912
"UKIP will introduce a modified UK Single Farm Payment (SFP) scheme of £80 per acre for lowland farms, with comparable arrangements for lower grades of land, capped at £120,000.",703,914
"Golf courses, airfields, racetracks and other non-productive areas will be excluded, as will land used for solar panels or land within 25 metres of a wind turbine.",703,915
"Land must conform to 2013 Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) requirements, where points are accrued according to criteria such as hedgerow maintenance, wild bird cover, wild flower mixes, etc., to qualify for subsidies.",501,916
Organic farms will be paid a 25 per cent premium on the SFP,703,917
UKIP will add rare breed maintenance to the ELS points system,703,918
"There will be no set-aside, cropping or rotation restrictions",703,919
"SFP will be paid to who ever takes financial responsibility for the farming enterprise on a field-by-field basis (i.e. the farmer, not the landowner)",703,920
Hill farmers will receive additional headage payments on livestock numbers within World Trade Organisation rules.,703,921
"UKIP will support dairy farmers by requiring the Competition Commission to promote fair practice in the food chain, in addition to considering price and competition issues.",703,923
This will allow producers to create larger cooperatives and alliances to counter the power of purchasing cartels.,703,924
"We will also refine the brief of the Grocery Adjudicator, who arbitrates on trade relationships between the large retailers and their suppliers, if necessary.",703,925
"We will scrap the Electronic Individual Identification Document for sheep,",703,926
"and introduce a pragmatic solution to distinguish between lamb and mutton at the abattoir, reducing costs for farmers by changing the definition of an aged sheep.",703,927
"UKIP will match-fund grants made by local authorities towards rural capital projects, such as creating a lake, wetland, repairing traditional stone walls, etc. which enhance the local environment, encourage rural education, or help recovery from environmental disasters.",501,929
"While we will abolish excessive and unnecessary regulations and directives, keeping those necessary to protect our environment, or replacing them with more appropriate controls, administered at national or local government level, will be a priority for us.",501,930

"UKIP supports research into GM foods, including research on the benefits and risks involved to the public.",703,933
We will allow a free vote in Parliament on commercial cultivation.,703,934
Food labelling will come back under the control of the Westminster Parliament when we leave the EU.,110,936
"Then we can insist animal products are labelled to show the country of origin, method of production and transport and whether the animal was stunned before slaughter, together with any information concerning hormones and GM products.",403,937
We believe strongly that customers have the right to see this information.,403,938
We can only regain control of animal health and welfare by leaving the EU.,110,940
UKIP takes both issues seriously and we will: Triple the maximum jail sentences for animal cruelty and torture,501,941
Impose lifetime bans on owning and/or looking after animals on any individual or company convicted of animal cruelty or torture,501,942
Keep the ban on animal testing for cosmetics,501,943
"Challenge companies using animals for testing drugs or other medical treatments on the necessity for this form of testing, as opposed to the use of alternative technology",501,944
Tightly regulate animal testing,501,945
Ban the export of live animals for slaughter,501,946
Insist on formal non-stun training and certification for all religious slaughtermen to ensure the highest standards are adhered to,501,947
"Install CCTV in every abattoir, monitored by the Meat Hygiene Service, and deal severely with any contraventions.",501,948
"Remove unnecessary EU restrictions that make small, local abattoirs unviable",110,949
We will also prepare for the possibility of disease outbreaks (including those) caused by imports.,703,950
"We cannot expect our farmers to bear the full brunt of any such outbreaks, but we will encourage them to introduce testing programmes and invest in insurance schemes to deal with potential outbreaks, as the poultry sector has done with the salmonella testing programme and associated insurance scheme.",703,951
"By the time Trevor sells the two boxes of whelks hes caught today, he will make the grand sum of about £45, before costs such as fuel for his boat.",110,953
EU quotas mean hes not allowed to catch anything else.,110,954
This is how utterly ridiculous the Common Fisheries Policy is: it is destroying our fishing industry and we must take back control from Brussels.,110,955
The EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was designed from the beginning to steal our fish.,110,956
It has ravaged our fishing industry and caused catastrophic environmental damage.,110,957
Fishing grounds have been so over-fished that some are at the point of collapse.,110,958
Our fishing fleet is half its former size.,110,959
"Britains seas should be the jewel in her crown, but we surrendered these priceless family treasures when we joined the then EEC 1973 and our territorial waters were merged into one giant European fishery.",110,960
The UK has almost 70 per cent of Europes fishing grounds but only 13 per cent percent of its fishing quota.,110,961
"So, we must import fish species such as cod, haddock and huss that our own fishermen are forced to throw overboard",110,962
 usually dead - because of EU rules.,110,963
"The EU itself estimates 40 per cent of all fish caught are discarded, so as much as two million tons of perfectly edible fish are wasted every year.",110,964
"The EUs proposed discard ban will not fix this problem, just move it onshore.",110,965
"Worse, while preaching conservation, the EU allows industrial fishing techniques such as electric pulse trawling, which destroys marine life and disturbs the ecological balance of our seascapes.",110,966
We can only replenish Britains bounty of fish and restore our fishing industry if we leave the EU and withdraw from the CFP.,110,967
Then we can: Establish a 12-mile zone around our coastline for UK fishermen,406,968
"and a 200-mile exclusive economic zone under UK control, as is our right under international law",406,969
Reverse the rapid decline in our fishing industry and return £2.5 billion a year in fish sales to the UK economy,406,970
Enforce no-take zones to aid spawning and replenish fish stocks,406,971
Protect our coastal eco system by ending destructive industrial fishing practices,501,972
End the slaughter of dolphins by banning pair trawler fishing for bass,501,973
Work with our fishermen to solve discard and landing issues,406,974
Reverse any EU-wide drift-net ban in British waters,110,975
Issue permits for foreign trawlers once fish stocks have returned to sustainable levels.,406,976
"Smaller fishing boats make up the majority of the UK fleet but only receive only 4 per cent of the English quota, while the five largest foreign-controlled vessels take 32 per cent.",406,978
It is grossly unfair and damages fish stock sustainability.,406,979
Small-scale inshore fishing is the backbone of the UK fishing industry and we will end this injustice.,406,980
"Over 750,000 people enjoy sea angling in the UK.",110,982
"It is a profitable hobby for Britain: VAT income from sea angling is worth more than the value of all commercial landings and some 23,000 jobs depend on sea angling, yet the EU is planning to restrict anglers to catching just three sea bass a day.",110,983
We suspect this will eventually lead to EU controls on all angling and we will vociferously oppose this threat.,110,984
"We will ensure sea anglers and our under 10-metre boat fleet are represented on the Marine Management Organisation, which licenses, regulates and plans marine activities in the seas around England and Wales.",406,985
"At present, none of the fifteen board members are fishermen.",406,986
The EU is just not interested in sustainable fishing.,110,987
"If we want to eat fish in  the future, we must preserve our fishing industry and our marine ecology.",406,988
We can only do this if we escape the CFP and introduce our own sustainable fishing practice.,406,989

"From our Norman castles to Battersea Power Station, our heritage is an important part of our vibrant tourist industry, which supports three million jobs and contributes £127 billion annually to our economy.",502,994
Heritage was a dirty word in Labours Cool Britannia.,502,996
"Tony Blair moved the Department of National Heritage into the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and marginalised tourism by lumping it in with the responsibilities of the Minister for Sports and Equalities.",502,997
The Conservatives bulldozer instincts kicked in when the Chancellor removed the zero rate of VAT on listed building repairs.,502,998
"Maintenance bills for over 400,000 of our most beautiful buildings, owned by a surprisingly diverse socioeconomic group of people, were hiked by 20 per cent.",502,999
"Developers putting identikit houses on greenbelt land, meanwhile, paid no VAT.",416,1000
UKIP will end this discrimination against our historic legacy by: -,502,1001
"Creating a dedicated Minister of State for Heritage and Tourism, attached to the Cabinet Office",502,1002
Ensuring tax and planning policies support historic buildings and the countryside,502,1003
Removing VAT completely from repairs to listed building,502,1004
Introducing a presumption in favour of conservation as opposed to the current presumption in favour of development in planning legislation.,502,1005
"Too many seaside destinations face pressing economic, social and housing issues.",501,1007
"Old former large hotels that once sat grandly on our seafront have become houses of multiple occupation, or low-cost hostels.",416,1008
"The result, bedsit land, deters families, young professionals and retired people from moving to the area and deters business investment.",416,1009
"UKIP will fuel regeneration in coastal areas, transforming them into vibrant, growing communities by bestowing Seaside Town Status to areas in need of regeneration.",402,1010
This will give Local Authorities the power to:,301,1011
Access low-interest government loans to buy up and renovate poor housing stock and convert empty commercial properties into residential accommodation,402,1012
Issue Compulsory Purchase Order powers for poor-quality multi-occupancy accommodation,403,1013
Allow local authorities to introduce minimum standards for properties in receipt of housing benefit,403,1014
Restructure local housing markets so they are not excessively driven by profits from housing benefit income,403,1015
Refuse housing benefit payments to landlords in breach of planning legislation.,403,1016
We will boost the Coastal Communities Fund and expand its remit to:,403,1017
"End the scattergun approach, which sees funding allocated according to income from a particular area, rather than supporting nationwide regeneration",403,1018
"Prioritise larger-scale heritage, residential, retail and tourist regeneration over smaller scale projects",502,1019
Encourage regenerative arts projects into our coastal towns.,502,1020
We are very proud of our Save the Pub Campaign!,402,1022
"The UK has lost 21,000 pubs since 1980, mostly as a result of taxation, regulation, the recent decline in disposable incomes and long-term cultural changes.",402,1023
"The smoking ban and the alcohol duty escalator are estimated to be responsible for some 6,000 pub closures.",402,1024
To reverse this trend we will: Offer tax breaks to smaller breweries to encourage micro-breweries,402,1025
Keep the current excise duty scheme that exempts from duty cider and perry made by small domestic producers,402,1026
Amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open smoking rooms provided they are properly ventilated and physically separated from nonsmoking areas.,402,1027
Workers must not be required to enter smoking areas except for cleaning and other essential purposes when they are not in use,701,1028
Oppose minimum pricing of alcohol and reverse plain paper packaging legislation for tobacco products.,401,1029
"Cuts to the police force,",605,1032
"a plethora of insidious EU directives,",110,1033

all these have eroded trust and confidence in policing and our judicial and prison systems.,605,1035
Our internal national security has never felt so undermined.,605,1036
Since 2010 our internal national security has been weakened again and again.,605,1037
"It is UKIPs intention to draw a line under the cuts suffered by our police, prison and criminal justice services and provide them with adequate resources.",605,1038
"We must get our law enforcement agencies back into a fit state, so they can deliver the protection British citizens have set great store by in the past and which we have a right to expect in the future.",601,1039
"In addition to boosting the Border Agency by 2,500",605,1040
"we will also put 3,500 more front line personnel into the police and prison services.",605,1041
Our membership of the European Union and associated acceptance of the free movement of people principle means we are unable to prevent criminals arriving on our shores.,110,1043
"Truly horrific, tragic crimes have been committed in Britain by foreign criminals with long records in their home countries and petty criminality has risen as gangs of thieves, pickpockets and scammers have arrived from overseas to target the UK.",110,1044
We must leave the EU to prevent those with criminal convictions coming here.,110,1045
"By opening the borders to convicted criminals, previous governments have put us at unacceptable risk.",110,1046
We have been badly let down.,110,1047
"UKIP will do its utmost to deport foreign criminals and prevent those with criminal records from entering Britain, when we leave the EU.",110,1048
"This will help protect our nation, free up prison places and relieve some of the stress on the prison service.",110,1049
"Putting responsibility for law and order back into the hands of Parliament is key to UKIPs approach to law and order, justice and internal security across the British Isles.",601,1051
We will remove ourselves from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights: the Strasbourg Court whose interpretation of the European Convention of Human Rights has been known to put the rights of criminals above those of victims.,110,1052
Our own Supreme Court will act as the final authority on matters of Human Rights.,601,1053
We will also repeal Labours Human Rights legislation.,110,1054
It has given European judges far too much power over British law making and law enforcement,110,1055
and prevented us deporting terrorists and career criminals,110,1056
and from implementing whole-life sentences.,110,1057
"Our human rights will be enshrined in law via the introduction of a new, consolidated UK Bill of Rights.",201,1058
This will complement the UN Declaration of Human Rights and encapsulate all the human and civil rights that UK citizens have acquired under UK law since Magna Carta.,201,1059
"This new UK Bill of Rights will apply across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",201,1060
UKIP will fully uphold the principle of innocent until proven guilty.,601,1062
This tenet of law is fundamental to British justice,601,1063
"and UKIP will reverse the opt-in to EU law and justice measures, which disregard this fundamental principle, including the European Arrest Warrant and European Investigation Orders, which were enacted by the Coalition partners and supported by Labour.",110,1064
"Austerity cuts have forced cuts to policing numbers that have gone too far, placing citizen safety and trust in policing at severe risk.",605,1066
UKIP is committed to returning to a meaningful capita population-based policing resource.,605,1067
Serving officers should not be subjected to undue stress as a result of being over-stretched.,605,1068
Crime is not a lifestyle option UKIP will tolerate.,605,1069
"The more visible police we have on our streets, the more criminals are reminded of this fact and the more the public are reassured.",605,1070
Reducing the numbers of territorial constabularies nationwide will release finance onto the front line:,605,1071
"we  question whether 43 constabularies, each with a multiplicity and duplication of roles, is either a viable situation  or one suited to delivering operational efficiency.",605,1072
"This will not be a top-down process however, but an expert,  police-led approach, leading to collaboration and co-operation between constabularies and policing bodies  with the aim of producing structures more relevant to policing in 21st century Britain.",605,1073
We will also reduce the number of Police and Crime Commissioners in line with our objective of a reduction in the number of territorial constabularies to save money and tackle serious crime.,605,1074
The PCC role and remit will be reviewed before the next set of PCC elections to identify ´Best Practice´ that has been achieved across the country.,605,1075
The findings of this exercise will be used to establish a new Terms of Reference and role specification for the remaining PCCs to ensure that they are ´fit for purpose´ regarding the identified challenges for policing and the criminal justice system as a whole.,605,1076
We will also: Commit to keeping sworn and warranted officers under the service of the Crown.,605,1077
UKIP will not outsource or privatise UK policing,605,1078
Refuse to allow the introduction or deployment of the Euro Gendarmerie force within the UK,110,1079
Invest in new technology such as communications equipment and personal CCTV to combat crime,605,1080
"Ensure Britains police forces comply with the law and do not retain booking photographs, fingerprints, DNA, or biometric data of individuals who have not been convicted of a crime",201,1081
Seek to match the make-up of the police force to the UKs population profile,605,1082
Introduce an accredited system for police recruitment in line with UKIP policy on apprenticeships and vocational training.,605,1083
The nature of crime has changed dramatically.,605,1085
"The Internet, impossible to police completely, is growing as a medium to commission and commit crime.",605,1086
"Up to one third of women report being the victim of domestic violence, yet in itself it is not an offence.",605,1087
There is confusion concerning laws on carrying potentially lethal weapons.,605,1088
"While we once believed we had abolished slavery, people trafficking is increasing and modern-day slavery is a harsh reality.",605,1089
"UKIP believes it is time for a review of what is and what is not a criminal offence and we will commit to such a review,",605,1090
together with a review of commensurate sentencing policy to address the changing nature of crime today.,605,1091
"The emphasis of such a review is likely to be on up to date sentencing procedures and processes for internet/cyber crime, sexual crime relating to minors, fraud, aggression, intimidation, people trafficking and gang masters and drug & substance abuse.",605,1092
"Our overall approach to crime is one of firmness, coupled with deterrent and rehabilitative strategies and a focus on combatting crime that delivers clear social value outcomes.",605,1093
We are also clear that the interests of law-abiding citizens and victims must always take precedence over those of criminals.,605,1094
We also pledge the following: We will prosecute all cases of adult sexual behaviour with under-age minors.,605,1095
The age of consent will not be reviewed or changed,603,1096
We will adopt a zero tolerance approach to cultural practices that are either illegal,605,1097
"or which conflict with British values and customs, including forced marriages, female genital mutilation and so-called honour killings.",601,1098
We will enforce the law and prosecute where necessary,605,1099
"UKIP will seek to introduce new personal weapons legislation to reflect progress made on knife crime and combat the many different kinds of items now used to injure, disfigure or kill",605,1100
"We will not decriminalise illegal drugs, however we will focus on ensuring drug suppliers, not their victims, face the full force of the law",605,1101
"We will update licensing laws in response to calls from local authorities to limit the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 down to £2, to tackle problem gambling and anti-social behaviour.",605,1102
We will decriminalise one crime: non-payment of the TV licence fee.,303,1103
This will become a civil rather than a criminal offence.,303,1104
We will also review the cost of the licence fee with a view to its reduction.,303,1105
An early priority for UKIP will be to re-establish prison capacity.,605,1107
We will not risk allowing sentencing or parole hearings to be influenced by a lack of prison places.,605,1108
"In the first instance, we will free up prison space by removing foreign criminals, of which there were over 10,000 in prisons in England and Wales, according to the last reported figures from the House of Commons Library.",601,1109
"We support purpose-built prison facilities and the upgrade of older prisons, but will not reduce prison place numbers, or force an artificial reduction in prisoner capacity via any means.",605,1110
"If criminals do the crime, they can expect to serve the time.",605,1111
"Rehabilitation and reintegration into society for all prisoners is a UKIP priority, so it is essential that prisoners have sufficient numeracy and literacy skills to re-enter the workplace.",605,1112
We will introduce a system whereby suitably qualified prisoners will be paid to teach prisoners with a low standard of literacy and numeracy.,605,1113
Prisoners must sign an education covenant requiring them to complete their studies on release.,605,1114
Any money earned in prison must first be used to pay any compensation due to victims and thereafter towards further studies.,605,1115
Prisoners will not be given the vote.,605,1116
Those who have lost their right to liberty by committing a serious crime should also lose their ability to vote.,605,1117
"Voting is a civic right, not a human right.",605,1118
There is significant public concern about the ability of convicted foreign criminals first to gain entry to the UK and subsequently to obtain British citizenship.,601,1120
UKIP will not allow this to continue.,601,1121
"If they have been convicted of any crime, foreign nationals will potentially forfeit any entitlement to a UK Passport and to unrestricted entry to the country.",601,1122
We will introduce a fast-track deportation programme to  safeguard our national security and ease overcrowding and  pressure on our prison service.,601,1123
Foreign prisoners in receipt of  custodial sentences will be returned to their country of origin.,601,1124
"If they choose to launch an appeal, they must do so from their  home country, or the country to which they are deported.",601,1125
"They must also pay their own costs, or their home nation must fund their case.",601,1126
This policy will benefit the UK tax payer;,601,1127
is fair to all criminals regardless of origin;,503,1128
and reinstates UK judicial control.,601,1129
DNA testing and retention of DNA data results will be reinstated for all convicted foreign criminals.,601,1130
"This, in our view, is a major preventative step towards protecting UK citizens and our front-line security forces.",601,1131

We will introduce: The Citizens Initiative:,202,1148
"Every two years we will allow a national referendum on the issues of greatest importance to the British public, gathered via an approved petition, provided the petition has more than two million signatures.",202,1149
"The outcome of these referendums will be included in the Queens Speech, therefore allowing the public to directly influence legislation.",202,1150
"We will also pledge to put matters gathering over 100,000 signatures on the Commons Order Paper, to make sure they are genuinely debated and voted upon, not simply brushed over, as currently happens",202,1151
The Right of Recall: UKIP will give voters real power to sack their MP and scrap the bogus Recall measures introduced by the Tory-led Coalition.,202,1152
"Under our proposals, if twenty per cent of an MPs constituents demand it, within a period of eight weeks, a Recall ballot will be triggered.",202,1153
"We will extend this Right of Recall to all elected politicians, e.g. councillors",202,1154
An Open Primaries Bill: UKIP will introduce an Open Primaries Bill to enable any political parties that wished to do so to widen their selection process to include every local voter.,204,1155
Open Primary ballots would help ensure candidates in winnable seats need not be Westminster insiders.,202,1156
"As well as making MPs more accountable to the public, UKIP will make Government answer more directly to Parliament.",202,1157
"These will require Commons Select Committees to vote to approve the appointment of any new minister, senior civil servant or senior diplomat before they get the job.",202,1159
They will also have the power to veto such appointments.,202,1160
"The same rules will apply to senior appointments to quangos and inspection bodies, such as Ofsted",202,1161
"Expenditure hearings:  Until the 1930s, MPs were able to amend public spending plans.",202,1162
"Since then they can only can only cheer or boo government spending plans, which are presented to them as a fait accompli.",202,1163
"In order to control public spending and reduce taxes over time, UKIP will give the relevant Commons Select Committee the power to veto items of spending, but not increase them.",202,1164
"In an age of multi-party politics, our current first past the post  Parliamentary election system is unfair and no longer fit for  purpose.",202,1166
Most MPs are elected by a minority of their voters  and perhaps with as little as 26 per cent of the vote share.,202,1167
UKIP believes voters should know that every vote counts.,202,1168
"We  want an electoral system where each voter can vote for the  party they really believe in, rather than against one they do  not, for tactical reasons.",202,1169
"UKIP will campaign for a new, proportional voting system that delivers a Parliament truly reflective of the number of votes cast, while retaining a constituency link, so every vote really does count.",202,1170
"We will also: Restrict the entitlement to vote in British general elections to British citizens and, potentially, countries which have reciprocal voting rights for British citizens, such as Ireland",601,1171

Britain is more than just a star on someone elses flag.,601,1216
"The liberal metropolitan elite often tells us patriotism is wrong, that it is something to be discouraged.",601,1217
We are told we should be ashamed of our past; that we must apologise for it.,601,1218
Hints are dropped that wanting to celebrate Britishness is an act that touches on extremism.,601,1219
"We in UKIP, along with the vast majority of the British people, beg to differ.",601,1220
"We are not afraid to talk about the kind of country we are, have been, and indeed, want to be in the future.",601,1221
Neither are we afraid to tackle head-on cultural issues of crucial importance.,601,1222
"This clearly distinguishes us from the other parties, who have sought to denigrate our historic values of sovereignty, democracy, independence, patriotism and freedom by handing responsibility for Governance over to the EU.",601,1223
"UKIP will promote a unifying British culture, open to anyone who wishes to identify with Britain and British values, regardless of their ethnic or religious background.",601,1225
This is genuine inclusiveness.,601,1226
"We reject multiculturalism, the doctrine whereby different ethnic and religious groups are encouraged to maintain all aspects of their cultures, instead of integrating into our majority culture, even if some of their values and customs conflict with British ones.",608,1227
We believe multiculturalism has led to an alarming fragmentation of British society.,608,1228
"UKIP does want people to integrate and,",608,1229

Uphold freedom of speech within the law,201,1234

"These blinkered doomsayers are not just unpatriotic, they are very, very wrong.",601,1270
"Prior to joining the EU, Britain struck her own trade deals and traded freely across the globe.",110,1272
We surrendered our trade negotiating rights when we signed up to what was then the EEC and vacated our seat on the World Trade Organisation (WTO).,110,1273
"Britain has not negotiated a single trade deal since 1975 and, while we remain in the EU, we will never negotiate one again.",110,1274

"We do not have to be members of the EU in order to trade with the EU, or any other country.",110,1277
More than sixty non-EU countries have trade deals with the EU.,110,1278
"In 2013, the top twenty of these, countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Hong Kong, Canada, Nigeria, Mexico and Australia, together exported goods and services worth 2.593 trillion to EU countries, according to the EUs own figures, more than our entire economy in the same year.",110,1279
"Moreover, six of the top ten countries that export to the EU do not have a trade agreement with the EU at all: China, Russia, the USA, Japan, India and Brazil.",110,1280
Being in the EU is no guarantee of greater financial rewards than being out in terms of trade:,110,1281
"non-EU Switzerland, with an economy one-quarter the size of ours, exports four and a half times more to the EU, per capita, than the UK does.",110,1282
"The inconvenient truth for our Europhile political class is that political union offers no advantages to trade, although it may inhibit it.",110,1283

"This is what we will seek and without doubt achieve, possibly within a very short period of time.",110,1288
"The UK has been a leader in international trade for centuries, long before the European Union.",110,1289
"We will continue to trade internationally after Brexit, enjoying the rights inherent in the WTOs Most Favoured Nation principle.",110,1290

"With over 100 other international organisations counting the UK as a full member, we will be in a very strong negotiating position when we leave the EU.",110,1292
Suggestions that the EU would refuse to negotiate a trade deal with Britain if we left the Union are nothing more than scaremongering.,110,1293

The Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft programme has been cancelled.,104,1310
"The aircraft carrier fleet has been decommissioned, despite having no operational replacements available until 2020.",104,1311
These cuts have demoralised our Armed Forces and left the nation unprepared to face emerging threats.,104,1312
Our current level of military spending and staffing is not fulfilling the terms of our NATO membership - which requires that we spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence -,104,1314
and the government has failed to lay out details of spending plans beyond 2015/16.,104,1315
"On the basis that the current base level of defence spending is maintained after 2015/16 at 1.9 per cent, UKIP will increase the defence budget to meet our obligations to NATO and spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence in 2015/16.",104,1316
We will exceed it substantially for the remaining years of the parliament.,104,1317
We will phase in increased defence spending over the next five years up to an additional £4 billion by 2020.,104,1318
"This will return funding to the pre-SDSR level, and allow for £1 billion yearly expenditure on capital projects deemed to be of the highest strategic priority by the MoD.",104,1319
"We will rebuild our Armed Forces and restore them to their rightful place among the most professional, flexible and effective fighting forces in the world, able to meet the security demands of the modern era and react appropriately to any threat that the UK faces both now and in the future.",104,1320
"Faced with rogue states such as North Korea and Iran, which have developed advanced nuclear capabilities, UKIP does not believe now is the time to be talking about or proposing nuclear disarmament and we support Trident renewal.",104,1322
The two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are superb operational platforms.,104,1324
"UKIP supports their deployment, while having reservations about the Royal Navys ability to man, operate and protect them:",104,1325
it could take nearly every ship in the current fleet to form an effective carrier group.,104,1326
"We also have reservations about the development of the American F-35B Lightning II aircraft that are due to fly from the carriers by 2020, given the massive technical problems involved.",104,1327
This platform may never be mission-capable.,104,1328
We will investigate further whether it would be better to commission an off-the-shelf aircraft option and adapt the two Queen Elizabeth class carriers for non-vertical take-off and landings.,104,1329
"Currently, British intelligence is fragmented between a number of agencies, including MI5, MI6, GCHQ and BBC Monitoring.",104,1331
All have different funding streams and report to different government departments.,104,1332
This generates a significant overlap in work and resources and risks exposing gaps in the system.,104,1333
"UKIP will create a new over-arching role of Director of National Intelligence (subject to confirmation hearing by the relevant Commons Select Committee), who will be charged with reviewing UK intelligence and security, in order to ensure threats are identified, monitored and dealt with by the swiftest, most appropriate and legal means available.",104,1334
He or she will be responsible for bringing all intelligence services together; developing cyber security measures; cutting down on waste and encouraging information and resource sharing.,104,1335
UKIP will revise the Armed Forces terms of service to ensure personnel on operational duty overseas do not pay income tax.,104,1337

We will honour the Military Covenant.,104,1344
"UKIP will create a dedicated Minister for Veterans, attached to the Cabinet Office to head up a Veterans Administration (VA).",104,1345
The VA will work with current MoD veteran services and established charities to provide a single point of contact for veterans in a range of fields:,104,1346
"health care, housing, counselling, education and training, rehabilitation, hospital care, access to veteran financial services, benefits and memorialisation.",104,1347
"Issues such as veteran homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse and mental health problems will also come under this remit, as will rolling out the following initiatives by 2020:",104,1348
"We believe members of our Armed Forces should have access to expert care services, configured to meet the specific needs of serving forces personnel and veterans.",104,1350
"Britain is the only major country in Europe that does not have a dedicated military hospital, so we will build one.",104,1351
It will provide specialist physical and mental health services and provide accommodation for 150 relatives or friends on site.,104,1352
"9,000 homeless people are ex-forces, as are one in ten people sleeping rough on the streets, according to charities Combat Stress and Crisis.",104,1354
That those who have been willing to defend our homeland have ended up without a home themselves is appalling.,104,1355
"By 2020, UKIP will build eight halfway house veterans hostels, each with 200 rooms and modelled on similar hostels already in operation.",104,1356
We will also built 500 affordable rent homes every year for ex-forces personnel.,104,1357
"We will guarantee the offer of a job in the police service, prison service or border force for anyone who has served in the Armed Forces for a minimum of 12 years.",104,1359
"This policy will also help meet our pledge to fund an additional 6,000 full time positions across these three organisations.",104,1360
"We will secure our borders, get more police on the streets, have safer prisons and honour the Military Covenant.",104,1361
Skills gained in the forces can be useful when running a small business.,104,1363
"We will create a Boots to Business scheme to channel loans, grants and access to free professional advice and mentors to veterans who wish to set up and run their own businesses after leaving the forces.",104,1364
Key roles for the VA will include bereavement support;,104,1366
the issue of a veteran service card to ensure fast-track access to NHS mental health care;,104,1367
"and the award of a National Defence Medal to all veterans, irrespective of rank or length of service.",104,1368
"The current anomaly in the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme will be rectified, so no veteran has to use their war pension to pay for social care, whenever they were injured.",104,1369
These entitlements will be extended to service personnel from overseas.,104,1370
"If they have shared the responsibility, stress and danger associated with military service, they should be entitled to exactly the same benefits as the man or woman who stood at their side.",104,1371
Britains role in the world has changed significantly over the past few decades.,105,1373
"Instead of concerning ourselves with securing peace, British forces have been deployed around the world in a series of conflicts that seem to have worsened, instead of improved, our security situation.",105,1374
"Since 1997, Labour and the Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition have deployed our Armed Forced to conflicts in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Libya and Iraq, while maintaining the War on Terror.",105,1375
They proposed military action in Syria.,105,1376
"Latest deployments include deterrent exercises in Poland and the Baltic States and a little publicised, but substantial, deployment to Nigeria.",105,1378
These interventions have stretched the UKs Armed Forces to the limit and damaged our reputation in the international community.,105,1379
They have caused social problems here at home,105,1380
and jaded the British publics attitude towards involvement in future conflicts.,105,1381
Iraq is a much more dangerous place today.,105,1382
So is Libya,105,1383
"Britains increasing involvement with European Union expansionism is putting us increasingly, unnecessarily, at loggerheads with Russia.",110,1384
The MoD recently told Ukraine it can count on any possible assistance in maintaining its territorial integrity.,105,1385
It is yet another sign that our political leaders are willing to put our troops in harms way at the behest of other countrys political agendas.,105,1386
"We have to be clear: we should stand firmly alongside our allies around the world,",107,1387
but cannot continue committing troops into conflict at the drop of a hat  often under-resourced -,105,1388
and with a veterans policy that lets down those returning from the horrors of war.,105,1389
"Our commitment to NATO must be upheld and we will not shirk our responsibilities towards our allies,",104,1390
"but UKIP believes our parliamentary democracy should be consulted at every opportunity, before committing any taxpayer resources, or our forces, to combat situations.",202,1391
"UKIP acknowledges there are real, existential threats around the world.",104,1392
"The rise of Islamic extremism is at the forefront of this and, indeed, is possibly the most important battle of our generation.",104,1393
"But the fight with and against this ideology is not best fought on a battlefield 3,000 miles away,",105,1394
"but at home, where we have significant problems of radicalisation and incitement to terrorism",605,1395
"In Europe, UKIP would push for commitments from our European neighbours, as well as multi-national organisations, to guarantee the British sovereignty and territorial integrity of Gibraltar and its waters.",109,1397
"In the South Atlantic, we must not negotiate or kowtow to Argentine aggression over the Falkland Islands, but uphold and respect the islanders decision  through the self-determination of a recent referendum  their overwhelming desire and right to remain British.",109,1398
"In the Middle East, UKIP wants to see nations at peace,",106,1399
"but acknowledges that sectarianism, fuelled by historical Western involvement, has rendered this all but impossible within a generation.",105,1400
"We want to see a peaceful, two-state solution in Israel and the Palestinian territories.",106,1401
"Britain is not merely a European country, but part of a global community, the Anglosphere.",107,1402
"Beyond the EU and even the Commonwealth are a network of nations that share not merely our language but our common law, democratic traditions and global trading interests.",107,1403
"From India to the United States, New Zealand to the Caribbean, UKIP would want to foster closer ties with the Anglosphere.",107,1404
"Around the rest of the globe, UKIPs policies, including opening up from a small, Euro-centric view of the world  wherein we are bound by EU membership not to negotiate our own trade deals- to becoming a sovereign nation that can trade with other countries, would once again inform our foreign policy.",110,1405
"Once unbound from the EU, Britain would once again take her place in the family of nations as an independent, sovereign state, free to negotiate her own trade deals and determine her own foreign policy objectives.",109,1406
"We believe nations which trade with one another are less likely to go to war with each other and, it is on this basis, that we would seek to create a more global Britain, fully able to pursue her own interests.",109,1407
"Ultimately, UKIP wants to help lift people out of poverty through trade, not aid.",107,1408
"In the meantime, well continue to support the poorest people on earth through programmes that prioritise clean water and sanitation, vaccinations and disaster relief.",107,1409
The politics of austerity has taken its toll.,503,1410
Hundreds of thousands of people in Britain are relying on foodbanks for survival.,503,1411
`Pensioners are freezing to death in winter as a result of rising fuel bills.,503,1412
The NHS is under severe financial strain.,504,1413
"Social care budgets have been slashed, leaving some of the most needy in our society without adequate support.",503,1414
Our young people have been forced into debt by a 200 per cent increase in tuition fees.,503,1415
"Despite this severe economic hardship, MPs and peers in all parties except UKIP voted to massively increase foreign aid expenditure, borrowing money that will increase the national debt we leave to our children.",109,1416
It is now enshrined in law that we must pay 0.7 per cent of our Gross National Income (GNI) on aid every year.,109,1417
"The old parties pushed ahead with this expenditure regardless, ignoring considerable evidence that the money spent on overseas aid is not well directed or controlled and that much is wasted, lost to corruption or handed to countries already wealthy enough to have their own space programmes, nuclear weapons and even overseas aid programmes of their own.",109,1418
UKIP will repeal recent legislation committing aid spending to 0.7 per cent of GNI.,109,1419
We object to taxpayers money being sent to already economically thriving countries;,109,1420
countries with poor human rights records;,201,1421
and to money being spent on politically correct vanity projects that do nothing to lift developing nations out of poverty.,109,1422
We also believe charity should begin at home.,109,1423
"UKIP will bring overseas aid spending into line with that of the United States, which has a very similar level of deficit and overall debt as a percentage of GNI to the UK.",109,1424
USA aid currently stands at 0.2 per cent of GNI and this is what we will match.,109,1425
"This change will be phased in over three years and the UK level of overseas aid will remain substantial, not falling below £4 billion per annum, more than given by Spain and Italy combined.",109,1426
Projects in progress will be completed and any contractual obligations met.,107,1427
"We will require all project expenditure to have clear, definable outcomes and future spending priorities will focus on emergency relief, healthcare, inoculation against preventable diseases and clean water and sanitation programmes.",107,1428
"The contracts for delivery of these programmes will be offered to British providers first, following removal of the EU Procurement Directive.",110,1429
"Removing barriers to trade is a far more effective way to tackle poverty than giving aid hand-outs, which can provide incentives for corrupt leaders to stifle economic progress.",401,1431
"This is where UKIP will focus: having escaped from the EUs protectionism, which has a negative impact on international development,",110,1432
"we will be better placed to help provide sustainable livelihoods for the worlds poorest people, by giving them free access to the British market.",401,1433
"DFID has already shown itself to be wasteful and lacking in focus on aid outcomes, yet its budget has been protected from recent government cuts.",303,1435
"UKIP takes a very different view: when DFIDs budget is reduced, we see no reason to keep DIFD running as an independent Government department.",303,1436
"We will close DFID and merge its essential functions into the Foreign Office, retaining a single Minister for Overseas Development.",303,1437
UKIPs position has been quite unfairly and misleadingly labelled anti-Europe.,110,1440
"We are not anti-Europe, but we are firmly opposed to political integration within Europe.",110,1441
"Back in 1972, we were told we were joining a common market.",110,1442
What we actually joined was a supranational political union.,110,1443
"We have lost our rights of self-government in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe, which has its own flag, national anthem, parliament, central bank, court of justice, a vast civil service, and fledgling military and police forces.",110,1444
The tentacles of the EU stretch into almost every area of our national life.,110,1445
"The EU has complete control over British financial services, fishing, farming, energy and trade.",110,1446
It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules.,110,1447
"It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services, our foreign affairs and tax policy.",110,1448
There is significant momentum behind plans for a EU-wide army and police force.,110,1449
"The EU shares responsibility with us for many other policy areas, including animal welfare, consumer protection, public health, space programmes, social policy, humanitarian aid and vocational training, to mention but a few.",110,1450
"On these and many other issues, our elected Westminster politicians are impotent.",110,1451
"They pretend to have the power to influence these matters, but actually they have none.",110,1452
"It is an out-of-sight, unaccountable, pan-European bureaucratic elite which has the final say and they do not consider Britains best interests.",110,1453
The European Parliament is no safeguard.,110,1454
It is a sham democracy: our MEPs are not allowed to generate or re-visit existing legislation.,110,1455
"They can only vote on decisions made by unelected Commissioners and, even then, their vote can be ignored.",110,1456
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by leaving the EU.,110,1457
"Despite the fact we are the worlds fifth largest economy and the seventh largest manufacturing nation, we will never again make a direct trade deal with any other nation until we leave the EU.",110,1458
We will never control our borders or manage immigration.,110,1459
We will never be able to prevent foreign trawlers plundering our seas of precious fish.,110,1460
"If the EUs plans for tax harmonisation come to fruition, soon we may find we cannot even set our own taxes.",110,1461
What else is coming down the tracks?,110,1462
"A British exit from the EU, Brexit, is the only choice open to us, if we are to make our own laws and control our own destiny.",110,1463
"Unless we leave, our democracy, our law-making powers and our sovereignty will continue to be salami-sliced away by the EU.",110,1464
"Genuine reform is impossible: successive EU Presidents, senior officials and European Prime Ministers have confirmed there is no hope of Britain negotiating any opt-outs, or special treatment.",110,1465
"As far as our influence goes, we have very little anyway.",110,1466
"As the European Union has expanded, our vote share in the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European Commission, has declined to the point where it is now almost insignificant.",110,1467
"We can vote no to proposals as often as we like, but unless other countries agree, measures will go on become British law anyway.",110,1468
"For all these reasons and more, Britain is better off out.",110,1469
This is our roadmap to freedom: the process that will lead Great Britain out of the EU and into the world.,110,1470
UKIP believes British citizens should have an in/out referendum on our membership of the EU as soon as possible.,110,1472
Our question of choice will be:,110,1473
"Only British citizens will be allowed to vote and there will be strict spending limits for both yes and no camps, together with fair, balanced and equal media coverage of both arguments.",110,1475
"Following a vote to leave, we have two legal options:",110,1476
We repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and leave immediately,110,1477
We activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and notify the European Council that the UK has decided to leave the EU in two years time.,110,1478
"The second option provides for a sensible, orderly exit and this is the option we prefer.",110,1479
"Having activated Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, we will set a fixed date, two years ahead, on which we intend to leave, while recognising we could leave earlier.",110,1481
Then we will begin amicable negotiations.,110,1482
"British exit will be a huge relief for many other EU members, who have known all along that the vast majority of the British people find the idea of political union with the rest of Europe abhorrent.",110,1483
"They are fully aware that we would never have joined the EU, had the political nature of the enterprise not been deliberately concealed from the electorate in 1975.",110,1484
"Our leaving will set them free to have full political union, if that is what they really want",110,1485
"and set us free to make the most of all our links with the Commonwealth,",101,1486
"with North America,",101,1487
"Australasia, much of Africa, the Indian subcontinent and all the other countries where English is the first or second language, as well as, of course, with Europe and the EU itself.",107,1488
The UK is the EUs largest export market,107,1489
"and, militarily, the strongest European member of NATO.",104,1490
"With Russia once more flexing its muscles and controlling much of the energy supplies to Western Europe, the other EU member states will have more than a casual interest in making sure their relationship with us remains amicable.",107,1491
What do we wish to achieve from our negotiations with the EU?,407,1493
"Our objectives are clear: Firstly, we will secure trade agreements with the EU, the 40 nations with trade agreements with the EU and other nations of interest to us.",407,1494
"As a G7 member, a leading world economy, the fifth largest by GDP, this will be a rapid process in most cases.",407,1495
Countries already trading with the EU will want to continue seamless trade relationships;,407,1496
other world nations will want to forge new trade alliances with the UK;,407,1497
and all nations will find it easier to deal with the UK directly.,407,1498
"As a minimum, we will seek continued access on free-trade terms to the EUs single market.",407,1499
Our custom is valuable to the EU now and will continue to be so following Brexit.,407,1500
"Secondly, there will be a wide range of issues on which we will want to continue to co-operate.",108,1501
"These include extradition treaties,",108,1502
"cross-border intelligence,",108,1503
"disaster relief,",108,1504
"accommodation of refugees,",108,1505
pan-EU healthcare arrangements,108,1506
and various other cultural projects.,108,1507
"We will also maintain our membership of pan-European institutions, such as the European Space Agency and the European Medicines Agency.",108,1508
"The Foreign Secretary will oversee the Brexit process and establish a Post-EU Secretariat, with responsibility for:",110,1510
Co-ordinating the disengagement,110,1511
Reviewing of EU legislation and directives as they affect each area of government,110,1512
Determining the post-EU status of all EU treaties,110,1513
Re-establishing the UKs membership of the World Trade Organisation,401,1514
Commencing free-trade agreement negotiations with non-EU countries,401,1515
Agreeing a UK/EU trade agreement,401,1516
Agreeing a UK/EU Brexit Treaty,110,1517
For 40 years the UK and the EU have been pulling in different directions:,110,1518
"Brexit will leave us free to fulfil our different destinies, while enjoying mutually beneficial and prosperous relationships with each other.",110,1519
"UKIP has set out six key Brexit tests and until each one of them has been met, we will not have the Brexit the British people voted for on  23rd June last year.",110,3
One of the most crucial tests is regaining the fishing rights Britain has under international law.,703.1,4
The Conservatives already look to be backsliding on this.,703.1,5
"UKIP believes the UK should have already left the EU, and that following the Article 50 process will lead us to make too many concessions to Brussels.",110,7
Theresa May has already shown signs of capitulating on key issues such as immigration,601.2,8
and freeing the UK from the jurisdiction of the European Courts.,110,9
What concessions will she make next?,305.2,10
"Theresa May should not be allowing the EU to influence how, when, and on what terms we leave.",305.2,11
"Ours is a position of inherent strength, and we should be acting from that position of strength, not giving up before negotiations have even begun.",601.1,12
"Repealing the European Communities Act (1972) should be the first, not the last step in the leaving process.",110,14
There is no legal or moral obligation to use Article 50; we have the legal right to withdraw from the EU unilaterally.,110,15
Article 50 is a trap designed to obstruct countries from leaving the EU.,110,16
"The longer the leaving process lasts, the greater the chance of the Referendum decision being overturned.",202.4,17
"Mays decision not to implement the decision of the Referendum as quickly as possible, but follow a slow route that suits the EU, is very worrying.",305.2,18
"By repealing the 1972 Act we could immediately take back control of key policy areas such as immigration and border controls,",601.2,19
"fishing,",703.1,20
"farming,",703.1,21
"trade,",407,22
"security and defence,",104,23
and police and criminal justice.,605.1,24
"All EU laws could remain in place temporarily, until they are repealed individually, amended , or allowed to stand.",110,25
"By now, a Bill for the repeal of the European Elections Act (2002) should have been placed before parliament, to ensure no British national can stand for election to the European Parliament in 2019.",110,27
"This would have been a clear sign that there is no going back on Brexit, yet this has not happened.",110,28
"Article 50 is not just a two-year process, as it makes provision for negotiations to extend for an indefinite time beyond that.",110,30
"We are likely to find ourselves facing protracted and tortuous negotiations with a recalcitrant, bullying EU for quite some time.",110,31
The EU has no incentive to negotiate a good deal for the UK because it does not want us to leave.,110,32
"The UK has massive exposure to the liabilities of the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, and various other financial mechanisms of the EU so long as we remain a member.",110,33
We will be expected to contribute to any Eurozone bailouts.,110,34
The EU will also have to plug a huge financial hole of some 12 per cent of the gross EU budget when Britain leaves.,110,35
These are just two very good reasons for the EU to keep us dangling on the hook for as long as possible.,110,36
"The longer the EU can keep Britain in, the greater the opportunity for a new government to reverse the referendum decision, or sign up to some kind of associated membership agreement which, to all intents and purposes, will be just like EU membership.",110,37
"Our government and our parliament should implement the referendum decision according to our own requirements, and then agree the terms of our separation.",601.1,39
"If Theresa May signs a withdrawal agreement which means we will leave in name but not in substance, she will have betrayed Britain to the EU, just as every Prime Minister has done since 1972.",110,40
"The fact that the political class is choosing to dance to Brussels tune proves UKIP is the only political party in Britain you can trust to deliver a true, unequivocal Brexit.",110,41
Only when the government has passed all these tests can we be sure the British people have got the deal they voted for on June 23rd 2016:,202.4,45
Parliament must resume its supremacy of law-making without restriction.,202.1,47
"Britain must be completely free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,",110,48
"and we must be free, if we wish, to relinquish our membership of the European Court of Human Rights.",110,49
"Britain must have full control of immigration and asylum policies,",601.2,51
and border control.,601.2,52
"We must be not be bound by any freedom of movement obligation,",601.2,53
and we must be free to set and meet our own annual migration targets.,601.2,54
"The UKs full maritime sovereignty must be restored and we must have control of our maritime exclusive economic zone, which stretches 200 miles off the coast or to the half-way point between the UK and neighbouring countries.",110,56
There must be no constraints on our fishing fleet other than those decided upon by the UK parliament.,703.1,57
The UK must retake its seat on the World Trade Organisation and resume its sovereign right to sign trade agreements with other entities or supra-national bodies.,407,59
"We must have full rights to set our own tariff and non-tariff barriers consistent with WTO rules,",406,60
and we must have left both the EU single market and the customs union.,110,61
"We must not pay any divorce payment to the EU, nor contribute to the EU budget.",110,63
"We must have been paid our share of financial assets from entities such as the European Investment Bank, in which some £9 billion of UK money is vested.",110,64
Brexit must be done and dusted before the end of 2019.,110,66
"Of all the tests for a proper Brexit, taking back control of our fisheries is key.",703.1,71
"The EUs Common Fisheries Policy is an environmental, economic and social disaster that has devastated fishing communities",703.1,72
and caused catastrophic damage to our maritime ecology.,703.1,73
"Until we have control of our seas and our fish stocks, we do not have Brexit.",703.1,74
"The EUs Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was cobbled together in 1970 as Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the UK were on course to join the then EEC.",703.1,75
"Together, these countries held 90 per cent of Western European fish stocks.",703.1,76
80 per cent of those stocks were British.,703.1,77
It was a cynical but legal way to seize the new entrants precious marine resources.,703.1,78
"The central tenet of the CFP, that there should be non-negotiable equal access to EEC/EU waters was a condition of EEC/EU membership,",703.1,79
"Some say Prime Minister Edward Heath committed an act of treachery when he capitulated to the CFP; certainly he allowed the UKs territorial waters to be plundered by industrialised fishing fleets, which led to huge job and tax revenue losses from fishing and ancillary industries.",703.1,80
The CFP has rightly been described as an obscenity because of its reckless fishing quotas and the discard policy.,703.1,81
"This requires fishermen either to throw back into the seas dead fish caught over quota, or to bring them back to port and send them to landfill.",703.1,82
Data on discards from Eurostat show discards equate to some two billion fish suppers thrown back into the sea every year.,703.1,83
It is environmental and economic madness.,416.2,84
"Once we leave the EU, we can also leave the CFP, take back control of our seas, and rebuild our fishing industry.",703.1,85
"UKIP will repeal this little-known convention, an agreement between twelve European nations and the UK, which recognises the historic fishing rights of vessels from the contracting parties to fish in the band of waters between six and twelve nautical miles from the UK coast.",703.1,87
"When the EUs Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply, the UK will automatically establish controlof a 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone giving our fishermen sole access to the seas within 200 miles of the UK coastline, or at the mid-point between two countries coastlines.",703.1,88
"However, the existence of the pre-EU 1964 Convention could offer a back door to continued EU fishing in British waters, as vessels belonging to signatory nations could cite this legislation and claim historic rights to fishing within the 6 to 12 nautical mile band around the UK.",703.1,89
The next governments willingness - or otherwise - to revoke the 1964 London Convention on Fishing could be indicative of their intentions for the fishing industry in the post-Brexit era.,703.1,90
"Article 15 of the Convention calls for a two-year notice period, so time is of the essence, yet to date no action has been taken.",703.1,91
Re-building our fishing industry and repatriating one of our nations greatest renewable resources will take time but it could be worth as much as £6.3 billion to the UK economy in net-to-plate income alone.,703.1,93
This is a golden opportunity for Britain: our fisheries must not be used as a bargaining chip in EU exit negotiations,703.1,94
"To take back full control of our fisheries, UKIP will: Leave the CFP and withdraw from the 1964 London convention",703.1,95
Restore the UK Exclusive Economic Zone in accordance with international law,703.1,96
End the obscenity of discards and make best use of all fish caught,703.1,97
"Introduce a time-limited, paid licence fee option for selected foreign vessels to fish within the UKs territorial waters, while the UK fishing industry re-establishes itself",703.1,98
"Launch an inclusive, collaborative consultation with the fishing community to draft a new Fisheries Bill",703.1,99
"Ensure all fish caught within UK waters, including those taken by foreign vessels operating under licence, are landed and sold in the UK, to help finance and attract investment in the newly developing UK fishing industry",703.1,100
"Create, train and equip a new Fisheries Protection Force, using a mixture of technologies in sea-and land-based methods, to police the UKs Exclusive Economic Zone.",703.1,101
"In addition to the economic, environmental, and social gains we will make in restoring our fishing industry, Brexit also offers a unique opportunity to regenerate British boat and shipbuilding.",411,102
We could develop our civil ship and boat building programme in line with the World Trade Organisations Trade Related Technical Assistance programme.,411,103
"Brexit Britain offers a host of opportunities, and nowhere more so than in our fishing industry.",703.1,104
"Reviving our proud and profitable maritime tradition will rejuvenate our seaside towns,",703.1,105
"enhance our coastline,",703.1,106
"produce much-needed skilled employment in economically depressed areas,",703.1,107
and secure the future for British fishermen.,703.1,108
UKIP will invest in the NHS,504,111
and care for the elderly.,504,112
"We will fund our schools,",506,113
"build more houses,",408,114
and rebuild our depleted armed forces.,104,115
We will do this without adding a single penny to anyones tax bill.,408,116
Our cost-of-living package will also save households £400 a year.,503,117
Brexit means we can take back control of those important areas of economic policy we have been forced to surrender to the EU for the last forty-five years.,110,121
We will resume full responsibility for taxation,202.1,122
"and have more room for manoeuvre when it comes to industrial and regional policy, without having to worry about EU state aid rules.",401,123
UKIP has always made the case for lower taxes,408,124
and an end to wasteful public spending programmes.,303,125
"We will scrap white elephant vanity projects such as HS2,",303,126
"replace the out-dated Barnett Formula with a fair funding formula based on need,",503,127
"reduce foreign aid to 0.2 per cent of Gross National Income,",109,128
and end our financial contributions to the EU budget.,110,129
These savings will provide us with £35 billion to fund our public service priorities.,504,130
"By keeping taxation low and incentives for wealth creation high, we will unleash the hardworking, entrepreneurial instincts of the British people.",402,131
UKIP will remove VAT from domestic energy bills,403,133
and scrap the green levies currently added to our bills to subsidise renewable energy schemes.,403,134
"Together, these measures will cut typical household energy bills by £ 170 a year.",403,135
Our plans to abolish the TV licence will eventually save households another £147.,403,136
"UKIP will phase out the licence fee over three years, giving the BBC time to adopt a new funding model based on subscription and/or advertising.",401,137
"We will expect the BBC to retain a core free-to-air offering on Freeview, maintain the World Service, and its local radio network.",502,138
"Grants from a new public service broadcast fund, financed from within current government resources, will be available to any broadcaster for specific programmes or projects.",502,139
"We will remove VAT from hot takeaway food such as fish and chips,",403,140
and from womens sanitary products.,403,141
Our economic approach revolves around restoring incentives for workers by cutting taxes,701,143
and ending the open door immigration that keeps wages low.,601.2,144
Reducing the tax burden on working people in the bottom and middle ranges of the income scale is our priority.,701,145
"By the end of the next parliament UKIP will raise the personal allowance to at least £13,500 so people can earn enough money tocover their basic living costs before the state takes anyof their income.",504,146
"We will alsoraise the 40 percent income tax threshold to £55,000.",704,147
A tax originally designed for high earners should not be levied on middle-income professionals such as teachers and senior nurses.,704,148
"When economic conditions allow, we will restore the personal allowance to those earning over £100,000.",408,149
"UKIP will raise the inheritance tax threshold to £500,000per individual, transferable for a married couple or those in civil partnerships, so up to £1000,000 in total.",408,150
Eventually we want to eliminate inheritance tax altogether.,408,151
We will also scrap Tory plansfor new and punitive probate charges.,408,152
"The rise in the retirement age to 66 by 2020 and to 67 by 2028 has been hugely unpopular, especially for women, whountil 2010 could retire at 60.",504,154
"UKIPs policy is to introduce a flexible state pension window, so everyone can opt to retire earlier, for a slightly lower state pension, or work longer for a slightly higher pension, as is the case at the moment.",504,155
"We will allow women to retire on this basis at 60, if they so wish.",504,156
The public has every right to be angry when multi¬national corporations fail to make their proper contribution to Britains running costs.,503,159
"PAYE is not voluntary, and corporation tax should not be voluntary either.",403,160
We will not let large companies get away with paying zero or negligible corporation tax.,605.1,161
"When we leave the EU, we will close the loophole allowing businesses to pay tax in whichever EU or associated country they choose, and bring in any further measures necessary to prevent large multinational corporations using aggressive tax avoidance schemes.",605.1,162
UKIP is not in the pockets of big businesses and we will make them pay their way.,403,163
"If Britain leaves the EU without a free trade agreement and we trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms, the Treasury will receive a tax windfall of some £11 billion from import tariffs annually.",406,165
"This bonus could be used to fund an across the board cut in VAT to compensate consumers for slightly higher prices, or other spending priorities.",409,166
"In this event, UKIP will also: Encourage a Buy British campaign: if the EU were seen to be punishing Britain, we believe the home market would support home produced goods",406,167
Cut unnecessary EU regulation from the 88 per cent of the UK economy that is not linked to trade with EU countries,401,168
Prioritise free trade agreements with non-EU countries.,407,169
"The annual public sector deficit may be reducing slowly, but our national debt has been doubled by the Conservatives, since they took office in 2010, to a record high.",414,171
There can be no more backsliding on returning to sound public finances.,414,172
We will support deficit reduction schedules put forward by the next government and vigorously oppose unnecessary spending plans.,414,173
"Only by backing enterprise,",402,174
rewarding success,402,175
and tackling waste in the public sector,303,176
can we hope to improve the economic legacy we pass on to future generations.,410,177
Jeremy Corbyns Labour party wants to squeeze as much tax as possible out of British businesses and British workers to pay for their outlandish ideas.,305.1,181
"Theresa Mays Conservatives are plotting hikes in dividend tax and Class IV  National Insurance contributions,",408,182
and want to make small businesses file tax  returns four times a year.,402,183
UKIP is the only party in this election prepared to back British businesses,402,184
and British workers,701,185
and help both to thrive.,410,186
UKIP is strongly pro-business.,402,191
"Helping businesses start, succeed, and compete in the global marketplace is a priority for us.",402,192
"Having long fought against excessive regulations enforced by Brussels, we make the case for clear-cut, sensible regulation to make trading easier,",407,193
balancing this with policies to encourage ethical and responsible growth.,416.2,194
"Britains 5.5 million small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, making up 60 per cent of the jobs in the private sector, according to the Federation of Small Businesses.",402,196
"UKIP will support small businesses by: Cutting business rates by 20 per cent for the 1.5 million British businesses operating from premises with a rateable value of less than £50,000",402,197
Making HM Revenue and Customs investigate big businesses or public sector bodies that repeatedly make late payments to smaller customers.,403,198
"Fines proportionate to the amount of delayed payments will be levied, and will escalate for repeat offenders",403,199
"Improve access to trade credit insurance to remove the drag on growth for businesses struggling to secure loans, and give small traders the confidence to expand their businesses",402,200
Encourage local trade by pushing every local authority in the country to offer at least 30 minutes free parking in town centres and shopping parades.,409,201
We will also freeze Insurance Premium Tax.,402,202
"Previous governments have raised this tax as an easy way to make extra revenue, yet it cannot be claimed back by businesses so increases have been especially tough on smaller traders.",402,203
"Local, regional and national governments have immense spending power totalling around £230 billion.",402,205
"While in the EU, they are required to offer contracts right across Europe, which has made it harder for British businesses to compete,",406,210
and forced them to jump through expensive bureaucratic hoops.,303,211
"Brexit offers the perfect opportunity to open up government order books to smaller businesses,",402,212
"and encourage local, regional and national procurement strategies that will deliver better value for taxpayers.",303,213
"UKIP will launch an urgent independent review of public sector procurement, with the aim of opening public sector contracts up to small and medium-sized businesses employing less than 250 people.",402,214
Recommendations coming out of this review will be put in place immediately after we leave the EU.,402,215
"Meanwhile, we will compel all public sector bodies to list contracts worth over £10,000 on the governments Contracts Finder website, to help more small firms access public procurement opportunities.",402,216
It takes courage and determination to set up your own business.,402,218
"Many self-employed people work for less than the national living wage, especially when they start out.",402,219
UKIP will stand up for Britains 4.8 million self-employed people.,402,220
"There will be no quarterly tax returns, and no increase in Class IV National Insurance or taxes for our self-employed strivers.",402,221
UKIPs goal is to keep taxes and red-tape to the minimum necessary.,402,222
"UKIP is not ashamed to say it: we should be offering jobs first to our own unemployed,",601.2,224
rather than inviting cheap labour from overseas to do the jobs British people are perfectly able to do.,601.2,225
Big businesses are the worst offenders here and we will prevent their deliberately overlooking the 11 per cent of young people in the UK who are currently out of work.,601.2,226
UKIP will bring forward legislation requiring employers to advertise jobs to British citizens before they offer them overseas.,701,227
"It is the governments duty to get our own unemployed off benefits and into the workplace,",701,228
"and improve prospects for our own people, rather than facilitate the continued importation of foreign workers.",601.2,229
We will also ensure employers are legally free to choose to hire a young unemployed British person under the age of 25 ahead of a better qualified or more experienced foreign applicant.,601.2,230
"Employers who wish to back British workers and give local young people a chance on the first rung of the career ladder should not face the threat of legal action, as they presently do.",701,231
"UKIP will make Gordon Browns British Jobs for British workers plausible, and meaningful in law.",701,232
UKIP will make it a top priority to reverse the decline of our seaside towns.,703.1,238
We will be the party that cares about coastal communities and does not write them off as being at the end of the line.,703.1,239
"Within our coastal enterprise zones, businesses operating from premises with a rateable value of less than £50,000 will receive a 50 per cent cut in business rates.",703.1,241
Coastal towns will have top ranking when it comes to national successor funds to the European Regional Development Fund.,703.1,242
Our new coastal towns taskforce will raise funding for new arts and heritage facilities in coastal towns.,502,243
"Our fishing industry has been all but destroyed by the Common Fisheries Policy,",703.1,250
"and many coastal towns have been pushed into decline with the rise of cheap package holidays abroad,",408,251
and transport and infrastructure projects that have been skewed towards big cities.,703.1,252
"The great British seaside is well overdue a revival, and UKIP will create a new Coastal Towns Taskforce to oversee a raft of measures to regenerate those areas of the country that have suffered most as a result of our EU membership.",703.1,253
Rundown housing has become an unfortunate hallmark of many coastal towns in decline.,411,255
"In coastal enterprise zones, local authorities will be given the power to: Access low interest government loans to buy up and renovate poor housing stock or empty commercial properties, to create quality residential accommodation",411,256
Issue compulsory purchase orders for poor quality houses in multiple occupation,504,257
Introduce minimum standards for properties in receipt of housing benefit,403,258
Refuse housing benefit payments to landlords in breach of planning legislation.,403,259
"These policies, together with the resumption of Britains 200-mile maritime exclusive economic zone one of our key Brexit tests  will boost coastal towns",703.1,260
and give our fishing industry the chance to rebuild.,703.1,261
The UK is suffering a housing shortage that has been 20 years in the making.,504,263
The waiting list for public and affordable housing stands at 1.2 million alone.,504,264
"UKIP will provide high quality, affordable homes, with security of tenure, where they are needed,",504,265
while boosting jobs.,701,266
Successive governments have failed to meet the housing needs of an increasing population.,504,267
"Of the 140,000 homes due to be built this year, 80,000 will be absorbed by population growth, exacerbated by immigration, so at best only 60,000 will begin to address the current chronic shortage.",504,268
"Labour, the Conservatives, and other parties in this election will promise to build hundreds of thousands of new homes, but their plans are not credible.",305.1,269
There are not enough workers in the traditional construction industry to meet their targets.,411,270
"Planning permission remains slow and difficult to obtain and developers have no incentive to build more, because under-supply boosts their margins and land bank values.",402,271
"UKIP is the only party being realistic about what can be done to increase the housing supply and putting forward a viable solution: a bold policy to roll out high quality, low cost factory-built modular (FBM) homes, affordable on the national average wage of £26,000.",504,272
Factory-built homes should not be confused with the pre-fabs of the past.,411,274
"They are built to last, to high design standards,",411,275
"and are energy efficient, with running costs up to 30per cent less than traditional homes.",411,276
"While conventional construction cannot in the medium term meet the need for low cost housing, factory-built modular homes can.",411,277
"When we leave the EU, we will regain control of the regional development budget, over £1 billion a year.",411,278
UKIP will use some of this to boost capacity in UK-based modular homes manufacturing.,411,279
"We will enable the manufacture of modular homes where jobs are needed,",701,280
and they will be built where homes are needed.,504,281
UKIP will establish a Housing Development Corporation (HDC) to acquire primarily brownfield sites  at existing use value and through compulsory purchase if necessary  where affordable housing is required.,504,286
Planning law will be changed to enable the HDC to give themselves planning permission to build between 10 and 100 FBM homes on an average site.,411,287
Homes constructed will be sold on a freehold basis to first time buyers up to the age of 40 who are British citizens and who have a 10 per cent deposit.,404,288
"We anticipate the total cost for a two-bedroom house will be under £100,000, including land purchase and restoration, construction, infrastructure and a contribution to the costs of the HDC.",411,289
"Utilities installation would be covered by a 1 per cent energy bill levy,",416.2,290
and Stamp Duty would not be applied.,403,291
"UKIPs proposal will bring up to 100,000 extra truly affordable homes onto the market every year.",504,292
"Combined with a traditional home building programme, we could build another one million homes by 2022.",504,293
"In addition, the FBM model would also make it feasible to deliver substantial numbers of new Council houses that have been promised, while traditional methods do not.",411,294
"As this scheme is a stepping¬stone from the rental sector to traditional home ownership, to address the current housing crisis, it must not distort the existing property market.",403,296
"So, homes will be for owner occupation, not private rental.",403,297
"Owners will not be able to sell them on the open market, but must sell them back to the HDC at a guaranteed price of cost plus inflation over the period of ownership.",403,298
"Ownership can, however, be retained indefinitely.",403,299
"UKIPs modular home scheme provides: High quality homes with security of tenure, where they are needed",411,301
A way for the next generation to build up equity and move into the traditional home owner market,503,302
A realistic way of building homes that is not constrained by the current skills shortage in the construction industry,411,303
Words and gimmicks from the old political parties will not solve the housing crisis.,305.1,304
UKIPs bold plan will.,305.1,305
"In addition to our FBM homes programme, UKIP will identify long-term dormant land held by central and local government so it can be released for affordable developments.",504,307
We will alsoplough all revenue raisedfrom Right to Buy sales into community housing,504,308
"and change the law to allow mortgages to become inheritable, as they are in other countries.",408,309
"Housing associations are accountable neither to taxpayers, who provide much of their funding, nor to their own tenants.",202.1,311
A UKIP investigation into the largest 50 housing associations uncovered a catalogue of failures.,303,312
"They are not building as many homes as private developers,",303,313
"the homes they do build cost more to put up,",303,314
and they are failing to tackle anti-social behaviour.,605.1,315
Average salaries for chief executives reach 51 times their tenants rent: one CEO is paid three times as much as the Prime Minister.,503,316
"Housing associations manage 60 per cent of the socially rented sector and have received £23 billion of Government funding in the past 14 years, but UKIP is not convinced they are benefiting either tenants or the taxpayer.",303,317
We will launch a review into their operation.,303,318
THE NHS is Britains best-loved public service and one of the benchmarks of our civilised values.,504,320
UKIP will keep the NHS free at the point of delivery and increase funding by diverting the £11 billion we will save by cutting the foreign aid budget directly into health and social care.,504,321
"Successive Labour, Coalition and Tory governments have overloaded the NHS with red tape",303,322
"and allowed it to be abused as an international, rather than a National Health Service.",601.1,323
The NHS is funded by the British people and should be for the British people.,601.1,324
A catalogue of failures has left the NHS in crisis.,504,325
"NHS Trusts are in deficit to the tune of £2.5 billion, hospital waiting lists for routine treatment have reached record highs, and tens of thousands of elective operations have been cancelled for non-clinical reasons.",504,326
In January this year 23 hospitals could not guarantee patient care or safety.,504,327
"The Royal College of Nursing says we need 24,000 more nurses, and NHS Digital estimates there is roughly one GP vacancy for every two practices.",504,328
"1,500 doctors leave Britain every year for better pay and more relaxed working conditions in Australia or New Zealand.",704,329
The NHS desperately needs additional funds.,504,330
UKIP will provide NHS England with an additional £9 billion a year by 2021/22.,504,331
An additional £2 billion for social care will fully utilise the savings we will make from the foreign aid budget.,504,332
"Despite our national doctor shortage, nearly 800 straight A students are turned away from medical school every year.",504,334
"UKIP will lift the cap on medical school training places from 7,500 to 10,000 and make sure nosuitable A grade student fails to get a place.",504,335
"Provided medical students commit to working within the NHS for at least ten out of the fifteen years after they qualify, we will cover the cost of all their tuition fees.",504,336
"Raising the cap on medical school places will help deliver the 10,000 additional GPs the profession needs by 2025.",504,338
We will also introduce new funding arrangements incentivising doctors to work in geographical areas most in need.,504,339
"However, GPs are also grappling with heavy workloads and over-regulation.",504,340
"We will end appraisal and revalidation work that goes beyond that deemed necessary by the GMC,",504,341
and reduce the burden of data collection and target chasing.,303,342
"UKIP will also fund the cost of streamlined return to practice training, and encourage retired GPs or GPs with small children to work part-time or in job-share schemes.",504,343
"For doctors who have worked overseas, we will make re-registering with the UK General Medical Council much easier by recognising comparable qualifications, experience, and accreditation.",504,344
Introducing a wider rangeof healthcare professionals and clinical services into GPsurgeries will also make general practice less stressful.,504,345
"We will fund additionalsupport staff such as physician associates, clinical pharmacists and health visitors in GP surgeries, and allow practices to operate a wider range of clinics, including minor surgery, where feasible.",504,346
"The NHS needs 24,000 more nurses and 3,500 more midwives, yet again potential students are being turned away, tens of thousands of them every year.",504,348
"UKIP will increase the number of nurse training placements,",411,349
"reinstate funding for bursaries to cover nursing, midwifery and allied health professions tuition and accommodation costs,",504,350
and cover the cost of re-training for nurses who have taken career breaks.,411,351
"We will discontinue the one per cent pay increase cap for frontline NHS workers earning less than £35,000 (Band 6).",701,352
UKIP will train more emergency medicine consultants,411,354
and improve their working conditions.,701,355
"Emergency medicine consultants cannot be expected to work unreasonably extended shifts, repeated unsocial hours, excessive numbers of weekends, or be regularly forced to cancel leave.",701,356
Every part of the health sector has a role to play in reducing A&E traffic.,504,357
"By improving access to and facilities in GP surgeries, keeping minor injuries units open, and sustaining funding levels for local chemists, we can start to address the A&E crisis.",504,358
"35,000 bed days are lost every month because of delayed transfers of care, and legal barriers can make it difficult to pass information between the two systems.",504,363
The problems caused by our disconnected health and social care system will not be resolved unless the two are fully integrated.,504,364
"UKIP will establish a Department for Health and Care, and create a sustainably funded social care system assimilated into the NHS.",504,365
Treating those ineligible for care costs British taxpayers around £2 billion every year.,601.2,367
UKIP will launch the toughest ever crackdown on ineligible foreign nationals using our NHS.,605.1,368
Only British citizens or foreign nationals who have paid UK taxes for at least five consecutive years will be eligible for non-urgent NHS care.,601.2,369
Anyone else must provide evidence of comprehensive medical insurance before being allowed to enter Britain and maintain that insurance for the duration of their stay.,601.2,370
Urgent care will continue to be provided to all in need.,504,371
"We will close any loopholes in reciprocal healthcare arrangements, making sure reciprocity is like-for¬like, and pursue any moneys owed to us.",605.1,372
We will also tighten the application and approval process for EHIC cards and review the scheme as part of our Brexit negotiations with the EU.,110,373
"To improve standards within the NHS, we will create the equivalent of a General Medical Council for NHS managers, making them subject to disciplinary control for the first time.",504,375
Managers will require a statutory Licence to Manage.,504,376
Removal of this licence would immediately bar them from working as a manager anywhere within the NHS.,504,377
"The wellbeing of staff is too important to allow incompetent, negligent or bullying managers to remain within the NHS.",504,378
Managers and board members will be held individually accountable for poor decisions.,202.1,379
Individual votes should be noted on significant or contentious matters.,202.1,380
"We will limit the amount that can be spent on an external management consultancy contract to £50,000.",303,381
The annual £589 million cost is far too high.,303,382
"Between 1997 and 2010, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown contracted private syndicates of hedge fund managers, bankers, and big property developers to design, build, and finance new hospitals and run non-clinical services.",304,384
"These syndicates charged interest rates so high, you might as well have called the scheme: buy one hospital, pay for seven.",304,385
These Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deals financed £11.8 billion worth of new build but will ultimately cost the NHS £79 billion.,304,386
"75 per cent of the syndicates involved are based offshore, so they do not even pay UK taxes on these enormous profits.",304,387
Labour is not the party of the NHS: Labour is the party that allowed the wealthiest in our society to laugh all the way to the bank at the expense of the NHS.,305.1,388
UKIP will end the use of PFI contracts within the NHS.,305.1,389
"Some 167,000 EU nationals work in the health and social care.",701,391
"UKIP has no hesitation in guaranteeing their right to remain here, whatever the EU decides with regard to the rights of British citizens overseas.",701,392
The five-year political cycle encourages short-termism that is unhelpful to the NHS.,404,394
"For it to be fit for purpose for another fifty years, we need honest, open debate, and viable solutions to the NHS funding crisis that are free from political interference.",303,395
UKIP will establish a Royal Commission to find a way forward that allows the NHS to hold fast to its values while meeting the challenges of the future.,303,396
"The 2012 Health and Social Care Act gave mental health the same priority as physical health, but only in principle.",504,402
"UKIP will put mental wellbeing on the same footing as physical healthcare, in terms of both access to treatment and funding.",504,403
"Unresolved mental health and addiction issues lie at the heart of some of our greatest social challenges: crime, homelessness, family breakdown, unemployment, and more.",504,406
"Every year, some 150 million GP consultations and up to forty per cent of A&E attendances are linked to mental health issues and drug or alcohol abuse, yet there are insufficient resources for doctors to refer patients to specialist care.",504,407
UKIP will increase planned spending on mental health services by at least £500 million every year.,504,408
"This sum could fund 6,000 clinical psychologists to see 500,000 more adults and young people every year.",504,409
UKIPs mental health priorities will be: Cutting waiting times:,504,410
The current target of eighteen weeks between referral and first appointment is far too long.,504,411
28 days should be the maximum.,504,412
"Closing the gaps between child and adult, and physical and mental care services:",504,413
There should be a smooth transition between these sectors with professionals sharing best practice and having a central point of communication,504,414
Getting funding to the right place:,504,415
National funding earmarked for mental health services is often being diverted to other NHS services.,504,416
This must stop.,504,417
"The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy says 80,000 children and young people in the UK are clinically depressed.",504,419
"Around three children in every class have a diagnosable mental health condition, and one in twelve will self-harm.",504,420
Figures from the Office for National Statistics are tragic: more than four suicides of young people take place every week.,504,421
"Mental health problems start before age fourteen in half of all cases, so UKIP will integrate mental health training into the teacher-training syllabus and develop a national school-based counselling strategy for England, on a par with Wales and Northern Ireland.",504,422
Specialist counselling services will be available in all secondary schools.,504,423
Looking out for those at risk must become everyones responsibility.,606.1,424
"If a child or teacher saw someone in pain, they would help.",504,425
Mental health problems also have clear symptoms.,504,426
UKIPs policies mean professionals will always be on hand to assist.,504,427
"Education should focus on personal wellbeing, practical coping skills, and developing positive social relationships, as well as academic performance.",504,429
"In stressing the latter, we have piled stress on our children.",504,430
"Our education system needs to be more balanced, so UKIP will introduce emotional health and wellbeing into the Ofsted inspection framework.",504,431
Those who have recovered from their problems are often best placed to help others facing similar challenges.,504,433
UKIP will encourage schools to invite specialist support organisations into school.,504,436
Letting our children know what resources are available to them may be life-changing.,504,437
"Elsewhere in this manifesto we condemn alien practices that oppress women, but we are not blind to our own failings.",503,439
"The lad culture, which treats young women as sex objects and the red circle of shame in celebrity magazines that hold women to unattainable levels of physical perfection are just two examples.",503,440
Boys too are increasingly developing eating disorders and body image issues.,504,441
"UKIP will review advertising, broadcast and editorial codes, seeking commitments that editorial coverage and advertising campaigns will treat men and women with dignity and promote healthy body images.",403,442
We will extend the remit of the current cross-government Internet Safety Strategy and invite participants to consider whether new legislation is required to address the problem of online abuse.,605.1,444
UKIP will not legalise classified drugs.,605.1,446
The social consequences could be catastrophic.,605.1,447
We will rigorously enforce current legislation.,605.1,448
Identifying drug users means they can be steered towards rehabilitation programmes.,504,449
Families in which there is a high incidence of addiction can also be identified more easily and appropriate support provided.,504,450
We include cannabis in this.,605.1,451
"Cannabis was used by 5.3 million 16-24 year-olds in the last year, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and this is extremely worrying.",605.1,452
"Teenage cannabis users are five times more likely to develop depression and anxiety, and those who use cannabis at around age fifteen have an above- average risk of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.",504,453
That risk is increased in those with a genetic vulnerability.,504,454
Cannabis can cause lasting psychotic illness.,504,455
"UKIP will ensure this message is emphasised by social workers, teachers, doctors, and magistrates.",603,456
"Over 5,000 service personnel were diagnosed with a mental health problem in 2014, but even this shocking statistic may hide a wider problem.",504,460
The charity Combat Stress says 40 per cent of serving personnel with symptoms do not seek help from the specialist Defence Mental Health Services (DMHS) because of general stigma.,504,461
This trend continues after discharge.,504,462
"To encourage serving personnel and veterans to report mental health issues, receive a diagnosis and access services, UKIP will: Integrate mental wellbeing monitoring into existing medical examinations for serving armed forces personnel in potentially traumatic or at risk roles",504,463
Extend the period during which discharged service personnel are able to access the specialist DMHS scheme from six months to two years.,504,464
Political interference in education has failed children.,506,471
We are tumbling down the international education league tables,506,472
and rising up the ranks for youth unemployment.,701,473
"UKIP will reintroduce grammar schools,",506,474
"invest in vocational education and technical training,",411,475
scrap tuition fees for STEM subjects,506,476
and prepare our young people for the world of work.,706,477
UKIPs approach to education is one where no child is held back,503,478
and where education is as responsive as possible to individual needs.,506,479
Our children differ vastly when it comes to talent and speed of development.,506,480
Our education system needs to be far more flexible.,506,481
"Without reading, writing, mathematical and learning abilities you will be held back in life and struggle to find well-paid work.",506,483
UKIP welcomes the recent reintroduction of phonics to the classroom and we will make this the model for teaching children to read and write.,506,484
"We will renew focus on mental arithmetic skills and learning times tables, andencourage children to learn languages from year 1 of primary school, when they will find it easier.",506,485
"UKIPs approach to secondary education focuses on a range of different schools: technical, vocational, selective grammars, and specialist schools.",506,494
"The state education system of grammar, secondary modern and technical schools was designed to make a high standard of education available to all, irrespective of social background.",503,496
Grammar schools improved social mobility by giving children from poorer backgrounds access tocareer paths they might have previously thought out of their reach.,503,497
"When the national grammar school system still existed, 25 per cent of schools were grammar or technical schools and nearly 65 per cent of their pupils came from the working class.",503,498
"They were not socially elite institutions, as anyone who attended onewill confirm.",503,499
The 164 grammar schools that are left no longer represent this classless ideal.,503,500
"Such is the high demand, it is often those with the most resourceful parents who gain access.",503,501
We need 800 more Grammar or Technical schools so every child who would benefit can get a place.,506,502
"UKIP will open a grammar school in every town, adapting the old 11 + system to add transfer examinations up to the age of sixteen, so pupils who develop in an academic direction, but not quite so fast, will still have the opportunity of a grammar school place.",506,503
"To give students a head start into a job, UKIP will introduce a scheme similar to Germanys Dual Vocational Training system, in which students attend classes at a vocational school and receive on-the-job training at a company.",411,505
Employment prospects for children who go through this system are high.,411,506
Germanys reputation for success in manufacturing and industry is second to none.,411,507
"UKIP will give our children the same educational choice to combine theory and practice in this way, so they leave school with technical knowledge and hands-on experience.",411,508
"The average student debt is £44,000.",706,510
"The poorest students who are now denied a grant fare worst of all, with debts averaging £53,000.",503,511
These debts are often pointless in career terms: the latest figures from the ONS show 46 per cent of new graduates will not find a job needing a degree.,507,512
The taxpayer fares badly too.,507,513
Only around half of the money spent on tuition fee loans will be paid back.,507,514
The quota system promoted by both Labour and Conservatives is not a good enough reason for taxpayers to pay for students to go to university.,507,515
Students would be better off following another route into the workplace than taking degrees that are unlikely to help them get a job or guide them onto their chosen career path.,507,516
The politically motivated decision to increase university places has deceived and blighted a generation.,507,517
"UKIP will stop paying tuition fees for courses which do not lead at least two thirds of students into a graduate level job, or a job corresponding to their degree, within five years after graduation.",507,518
We will also cease offering EU nationals student loans when we leave the EU.,110,519
"Repayment rates are extremely low and 10,000 EU students currently owe Britain £89 million.",110,520
UKIPs long-term goal is to abolish tuition fees entirely and we will seek to enact this as soon as economic conditions allow.,506,522
"Meanwhile, to help the poorest students now, we will immediately restore maintenance grants.",503,523
"To plug the skills gap in these areas, UKIP will abolish tuition fees for undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students, provided they work in their discipline and pay tax in the UK for at least five years after they complete their degree.",411,524
"We will cover the cost of all tuition fees for medical students, provided they commit to working within the NHS for at least ten out of the fifteen years after they qualify.",504,525
"School leavers should have an idea of what future career they would like to pursue, and how they can achieve an entry level job in that career.",506,527
UKIP will ensure effective career development assumes a more important role in the national curriculum and is assessed accordingly.,506,528
"Whatever level of education you have achieved, your chance of success in the workplace will be influenced by more than your academic abilities.",506,530
Employers want more from prospective employees than just good exam results.,506,531
"UKIP will introduce practical employability lessons into the careers syllabus, teaching soft skills such as interview skills, team-working and time-management, making presentations, public speaking, networking, making a good first impression, and developing social skills.",506,532
"These might not come naturally, but they can be taught.",506,533
"Often, the local job market will determine career choices, so schools and colleges should establish links with local businesses, to tell students what they need from new recruits, to offer advice, and to show how business works.",506,535
UKIP will include practical information about setting up your own business into the syllabus.,506,537
"Being self-employed is a sound career choice if you have a skill or idea others want to buy, and developing the skill to think creatively and ambitiously can only help in life and the workplace.",506,538
"Entrepreneurship education is becoming increasingly common in the USA, where it is seen to benefit students from all socio-economic backgrounds by nurturing unconventional skills and talents and encouraging them to think outside the box.",506,539
The next generation is the future of the UK.,706,540
"Our children need educational solutions that really work, not political dogma.",506,541
"Grammar schools, dynamic academies and technical schools in every town from Toxteth to Twickenham, combined with high quality vocational training and careers advice, will deliver real opportunities for our children.",503,542
"UKIP believes all disabled learners must have the legal right to attend either mainstream courses in mainstream education settings, or schools exclusively tailored to their needs.",503,544
It should be their choice.,503,545
"To this end, we will reverse the policy of closing special schools, and ensure all other schools are accessible to disabled learners and that individual support is in place for each child.",503,546
Childcare costs in the UK are becoming less affordable for ordinary families.,504,551
The parents of disabled children struggle to find childcare at all.,503,552
Fathers are prevented from seeing their children,603,553
and the family courts are not transparent enough.,202.1,554
Tackling these issues are key priorities for UKIP.,504,555
"UKIPs 2015 general election manifesto highlighted the complexity of childcare provision in the UK and how difficult it can be to find quality childcare, especially if your child is disabled, if you work irregular hours, or you are on a low income.",504,560
"Despite an increase in free childcare provision and new tax-free childcare schemes, recent research from the Family and Childcare Trust revealed British parents now pay more than £6,000 per year on average for childcare, double what they spend on food and drink.",504,561
The situation we warned about in 2015 has not improved but got worse.,504,562
Perverse government policies intended to expand childcare provision fuel childcare demand yet fail to cover costs incurred by childcare providers.,504,563
At the same time there is an acute shortage of places because of over-regulation and higher training fees.,504,564
"Nurseries and childminders limit places, raise fees, or introduce extra charges in order to remain sustainable.",504,565
"Despite more public money being allocated to free childcare than ever, the number of childminders has plummeted by 10,000 since 2012.",504,566
"This is a typical outcome of policy-making done via a bidding war, instead of being thought through.",305.1,567
"In this case, Labour and the Conservatives have jockeyed for position to see who can offer the highest number of free childcare hours for the youngest children, without considering the unintended consequences, or what else in the system might need to change.",504,568
"UKIP promised a far-reaching review of childcare provision in 2015, and this is still urgently needed, not least to de-regulate and simplify an increasingly fragmented system.",303,569
"Meanwhile, UKIP will allow parents to use their free childcare entitlements to access a greater choice of childcare providers by removing restrictions limiting them only to Ofsted-registered childcare providers.",504,570
We will also: Extend the primary school day by offering wrap-around childcare from 8am to 6pm during term time,504,571
Require local authorities to keep a register of childcare providers willing to provide emergency childcare cover at short notice,504,572
"Amend planning legislation in order to make play spaces compulsory in housing estates,",504,573
"and to promote nursery or crèche provision in developments such as shopping centres, office blocks, hospitals, airports, and railway stations.",504,574
"Smaller early years providers may struggle to offer places to children with physical or learning difficulties because of the extra costs involved in maintaining higher staff ratios, delivering additional staff training, buying specialist equipment and creating accessible changing facilities.",504,576
"This inevitably makes it much more difficult for such children to access the same high quality, flexible early years provision as their able-bodied peers.",503,577
"UKIP will create a fund worth £80 million a year to help childminders and smaller childcare providers employing five people or fewer, to open their doors to more children with special needs.",504,578
"Grants of up to £3,000 will be available to adapt their premises to make them more accessible, and to equip their staff with specialist training and equipment, so they can provide a more inclusive childcare service.",504,579
Our 2015 manifesto promised to legislate for an initial 50-50 presumption of shared parenting when couples break up.,603,581
"We stand by this, as we do our pledge to give visiting rights to grandparents and to review the operation of the Family Court.",603,582
"The concerns we raised in 2015 about the Family Court system, particularly in relation to forced adoptions, have become more pressing.",603,583
"Up to 96 per cent of children adopted from public care are forcibly adopted, against their parents wishes.",603,584
"No one wants to see children languishing in care, but until the Family Courts are more transparent, we cannot know whether decisions are made in childrens best interests or in response to adoption targets.",304,585
The latter approach risks serious miscarriages of justice.,304,586
Maintaining confidentiality in family law proceedings is not incompatible with scrutiny.,603,587
To strike the right balance between the two we propose: Removing the current blanket ban on media reporting of placement and adoption proceedings and allowing journalists to report on such cases on the same basis as other family law proceedings,603,588
"Publishing all case summaries, skeleton arguments, judgements and other documents relating to Family proceedings as a matter of course, on an anonymised basis",603,589
Requiring expert witnesses to list previous court cases in which they have given evidence,603,590
Promoting more extensive use of Special Guardianship Orders so that children can retain links with their birth family.,603,591
"People who have worked hard all their lives and contributed to our economy have been stripped of hot meals and essential home help under the Tories, and for what?",504,596
"To keep shovelling cash out of the door to prop up a corrupt foreign aid regime,",109,597
and fund a railway project to help their rich friends get home ten minutes faster,304,598
How we respond to older people is an indication of the kind of country we live in.,706,599
"We should take pride in making public investment into their care, regardless of their financial means.",504,600
"UKIP remains committed to keeping the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, prescriptions and eye tests for all over-60s, without means testing.",504,601
"We will maintain the triple lock on the state pension, increasing it every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.5 per cent.",504,602
"Age UK says older people contribute around £61 billion to the economy each year through work, caring and volunteering.",706,604
"Advancing age does not necessarily mean people want to stop earning, and their wisdom and experience should be seen as an advantage in the workplace.",706,605
"We will encourage businesses to fund job placements for older people,",706,606
and enforce laws protecting workers against age discrimination.,503,607
"As a population, we are living longer.",504,609
This would be good news were it not for the funding crisis in elderly care.,504,610
The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services calculates £4.6 billion has been cut from social care budgets since 2010.,504,611
The number of adults eligible to receive social care has plummeted by 28 per cent.,504,612
"This is counter-productive: the government says it wants to help older people stay active and independent, but then removes the support they need.",504,613
Most councils only fund those already in critical or substantial need and past the point of no return.,504,614
"No wonder older people are now more likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to be able to leave hospital when they recover.",504,615
"6,800 such patients every day cannot be discharged, so ambulances queue up outside A&E and planned operations are cancelled.",504,616
"This inefficiency costs the NHS approximately £1 billion a year, and it could get worse.",504,617
"Last year, research by BBC Radio 4s You and Yours found 59 home care companies had already handed unprofitable contracts back to local authorities, and that one in four care homes may go out of business within three years.",504,618
"The Better Care Fund was supposed to improve liaison between the NHS and local councils and ease pressure on hospitals, but the Public Accounts Committee found it was little more than a ruse.",504,619
"The freedom to raise council tax by two per cent to fund adult social care is of least help to councils in the poorest areas, who have less income from council tax, but the most pressing care needs.",504,620
The only answer is to reverse the cuts to care budgets.,504,621
"UKIP will put back money the Conservatives have removed, investing up to £2 billion every year into social care.",504,622
"We will prioritise early intervention schemes and community-based models of care that promote independence and wellbeing, such as supported living arrangements.",504,623
Institutional and acute care models should be a last-resort.,504,624
"We will continue to pay Attendance Allowance for all people over the age of 65 who need help with personal care, including new claimants, from central government funds.",504,625
We reject Conservative proposals that this benefit should be funded locally for all new claimants.,504,626
"Caring can be difficult and frustrating, and care staff deserve better pay and respect.",701,628
"We will address the culture of long hours, low pay and perceived low status that leads to high staff turnover.",701,629
"UKIP will not allow the NHS, or third parties under contract to local authorities, to employ home care workers on zero hours contracts.",701,630
Workers must also be paid for travelling time to prevent their being paid less than the minimum or living wage.,701,631
Dementia is predicted to be the UKs biggest killer.,504,633
"Already, 850,000 people in Britain live with dementia.",504,634
"UKIP will roll out a National Dementia Plan to recommend research and treatment priorities, and co-ordinate expertise.",504,635
"This plan will be developed in cooperation with multi-discipline dementia specialists to identify spending priorities and deliver a bold new programme of research, treatment, care and understanding.",504,636
"UKIP will treble the amount we allocated to dementia research and treatment in 2015, taking our total fresh funding pot to £400 million each year over the course of the next parliament.",504,637
"In January, campaigning organisation Disability United exposed clauses in Continuing Healthcare policies that stated home-based care would only be provided if costs do not exceed residential placement costs by a certain percentage, generally ten percent.",504,639
This could mean forcibly moving someone into a care home to save relatively small amounts of money.,504,640
"UKIP will make sure those with on-going health care needs choose where they wish to live, unless they are unable to make that choice themselves, or care at home becomes unviable.",504,641
Levels of unmet need for disabled and learning disabled people are at a record high.,504,650
"Sense, the national charity for children and adults who are deaf blind and have complex needs, calculates 108,000 learning disabled adults with moderate to severe needs now receive no support at all.",504,651
"Over the last year alone, the charity says the number of people in receipt of support for a sensory impairment has decreased by 11.4 per cent.",504,652
UKIP will not cut disability benefits.,504,653
"Personal Independence Payments, or PIPs, are replacing the Disability Living Allowance (DLA).",504,655
"Without a PIP, disabled people cannot access other benefits such as Carers Allowance or the charitable Motability scheme to get a powered wheelchair or accessible car.",504,656
"PIPs were supposed to help disabled people into work and pay a range of disability benefits based on individual need, but they seem to have become a covert way of slashing the benefit bill.",504,657
"Since disabled people were required to undergo a new battery of medical tests, 250,000 of them have had their benefit cut.",504,658
"Some 300 people a day who have their benefits cut following re¬assessments are appealing against these new decisions, at a cost of £1 million a week to the taxpayer.",303,659
"They are right to appeal, as six out of ten appeals are successful, but while they await the outcome of their appeals, many are falling into debt, and have vital support or equipment taken away from them.",504,660
"50,000 people have had accessible vehicles removed since PIPs were introduced.",504,661
The current Work Capability Assessments are not fit for purpose.,504,662
We will reform them in consultation with disabled people and disability charities.,504,663
"They must accurately assess the barriers faced by disabled people to enter employment,",503,664
and indicate what specialist employment support will be needed for those who are ready for work.,705,665
"We recommit to giving carers an extra five days paid holiday each year,",504,667
"and increasing Carers Allowance from £62.70 per week to £73.10 a week, to match the higher level of Job Seekers Allowance.",504,668
"Britons are among the most welcoming and tolerant people in the world,",601.1,676
yet they have lost faith in our immigration system.,601.2,677
"There is nothing in the track records of any of the other parties that suggests they have the necessary political will to address the concerns of the British people, but UKIP will.",305.1,678
Brexit offers an opportunity to calm public concerns about immigration,601.2,679
"while still allowing the brightest and the best from around the world to make their home in Britain, and contribute to our society and our economy.",602.2,680
Immigration has placed huge pressure on public services and housing.,601.2,681
"It has affected the domestic labour market, where wages for manual and low-paid jobs have stagnated.",601.2,682
Community cohesion has been damaged.,601.2,683
"Unsustainable immigration to Britain began  with Tony Blairs Labour government: Peter Mandelson admitted search parties were sent out to encourage migrants to come to Britain, and the plan to rub the Rights nose in diversity did indeed, as Blairs favourite think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, put it, change the face of the country.",601.2,685
"Allegations of racism, and a raft of faith, race and equalities legislation shut down any criticism of Blairs policy,",202.1,686
and the benefits system was abused to bribe Labours core vote.,305.1,687
"Labour ultimately paid the electoral price for their wilful blindness to problems caused by mass immigration, but the Conservatives have failed just as badly, for seven years reneging on their pledge to bring annual net migration down to the tens of thousands.",601.2,689
"Theresa May admitted in 2015 the case for high immigration on economic grounds has been massively overstated, yet did nothing about it,",601.2,690
and still appears prepared to carry on with unlimited EU immigration for many years ahead.,601.2,691
UKIP is the only party with the political will and the plan to cut immigration.,601.2,692
"UKIP will establish a Migration Control Commission and set a target to reduce net migration to zero, over a five-year period.",601.2,697
This means approximately halving gross immigration for a five-year period.,601.2,698
"This will still allow us to bring in the key skills we need, while giving a breathing space topublic services under immense pressure.",601.2,699
"Senior Labour parliamentarian, Frank Field, has argued the case for balanced migration such as this formany years.",601.2,700
"To make immigration fair and equitable, we will introduce a new Australian-style points-based system, and a work permit system.",601.2,702
"Both will apply equally to all applicants, save for citizens of the Republic of Ireland, with whom we will maintain our current arrangements.",601.2,703
"To give working class people in particular a chance to find employment, we will place a moratorium on unskilled and low-skilled immigration for five years after we leave the EU.",701,704
"We will also operate a seasonal worker scheme based on six-month visas to support thosesectors, such as agriculture, which need additional labour for short but predictable periods of time.",703.1,705
"Operated on a strict principle of non-discrimination between peoples of all nations applying for work, study, or to visit the United Kingdom, our new International Visa System will begin on the date we leave the EU and offer four principal visa categories:",503,707
"Highly skilled workers with a job offer sponsored by companies paying them a minimum of £30,000 per annum will have priority.",411,709
"Covering those who come to Britain as tourists, to conduct business, or to see their family, these will be valid for up to twelve months.",408,711
"We want to encourage students to study in Britain,",602.2,713
but will not tolerate abuse of the system.,605.1,714
"We respect the right of British citizens to form relationships with non-British citizens; however, we will abolish the European Economic Area (EEA) family permit scheme and reinstate the primary purpose rule.",601.2,716
Foreign nationals marrying British citizens will have to prove the primary purpose of their marriage is not to obtain British residency.,601.2,717
"U KI P will comply fully with the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and honour our obligations to bona fide asylum seekers.",201.2,719
"All new migrants to Britain will be expected to make tax and national insurance contributions for at least five consecutive years before they become eligible to claim UK benefits, or access non-urgent NHS services, save for any exceptions stipulated by the Migration Control Commission, or if reciprocal healthcare arrangements are in place with their country of origin.",601.2,721
"All new entrants to the UK must have and maintain comprehensive private medical insurance for the duration of their stay, as a condition of their visa.",601.2,722
"Those arriving on Work Visas may apply for British citizenship after five years, provided they have worked, paid tax here, and maintained their medical insurance throughout that time.",705,724
We will revoke the British citizenship of those who have obtained it by fraud or deception and remove them from the country.,605.1,725
There will be no amnesty for illegal immigrants.,601.2,727
We will increase the number of immigration compliance and enforcement teams.,601.2,728
Foreign criminals will not be granted a visa to enter the UK.,605.1,729
Migrants who commit crimes resulting in a custodial sentence will have their visa revoked and be detained until they are deported.,605.1,730
UKIP will allow law-abiding EU citizens living in the UK before Article 50 was triggered the right to stay here indefinitely.,108,732
We expect the same concession to be granted to British citizens living overseas within the EU.,108,733
"EU nationals who entered the UK after 29th March 2017 will not have the automatic right to remain and when we leave the EU will lose access to all benefits, including non-urgent healthcare.",601.2,734
No benefits will be paid for any dependants living overseas when we leave the EU.,601.2,735
"In Britain, we do not believe in treating women or gay people as second-class citizens,",503,737
and we hold to a fundamental belief in democracy,202.1,738
and free speech.,201.2,739
UKIPs points-based immigration system will therefore include one further major principle: we will test the social attitudes of migration applicants to foster community cohesion,608.2,740
and protect core British values.,601.1,741
"UKIPs immigration policies will bring to Britain the brightest, the best, and those with the talents our economy most needs.",411,742
"They are fair, equitable, and similar to those operating in numerous other countries worldwide, such as Australia, New Zealand, and the USA.",601.2,743
"They will benefit Britain, and redress the imbalance that has caused so much frustration, for so long.",601.2,744
"Britain has always welcomed people of whatever faith, nationality or creed who have wanted to make their home in this country,",607.2,748
but a lack of vision for an integrated Britain has led to our society becoming more and more fragmented.,608.2,749
"UKIP will take integration as seriously as we have immigration, and we will not tolerate the intolerable.",608.2,750
"Over many years, the policy of multiculturalism has fragmented British society by allowing new migrants to Britain to behave in exactly the same way as they would if they were still in their countries of origin.",608.2,755
"Multiculturalism has prevented criticism of certain religious beliefs and cultural practices, even those the overwhelming majority of British people would consider repugnant, and which threaten rights and equalities established in Britain for decades.",608.2,756
"Nobody voted for multiculturalism, yet all of us are living with the results of it.",608.2,757
"It is generally those who have little interest in preserving British identity, or who are indeed hostile to the very idea of it, who champion multiculturalism most fiercely.",601.1,758
They are vociferous in shutting down debate.,202.1,759
"UKIP will stand up for the equal rights of all people in Britain,",503,760
"and say we are proud of our country and its achievements,",601.1,761
"our values of free speech,",201.2,762
"democracy,",202.1,763
"independence,",601.1,764
and patriotism.,601.1,765
"We will promote British values in our legal system, in our schools, and in our society.",601.1,766
A society that can pick and choose what legal system it lives under gradually ceases to be a society at all.,605.1,768
"The growth of sharia councils is of great concern to the public, as is the apparent unwillingness of the political class to prevent them proliferating.",608.2,769
UKIP will take action: we will establish a legal commission to draw up proposals to disband sharia councils.,608.2,770
It is simple: there should be one law for all.,202.1,771
"If we compare the rights of women in the UK to those of the majority of women overseas, the contrast is striking.",503,776
Acceptance of the concept of sexual equality is largely confined to a handful of economically advanced nations.,503,777
"Mass uncontrolled immigration has opened the door to a host of people from cultures with little or no respect for women,",608.2,778
"yet when their views have been challenged, some on the Left of politics, in particular, have encouraged them to claim a victim status they do not deserve.",305.1,779
"UKIP will challenge those who do not uphold the rights of women,",503,780
"or who set themselves on a deliberate collision course with core British values of equality,",503,781
free speech,201.2,782
and democracy.,202.1,783
"We will protect all women, regardless of their race, ethnicity or religion.",503,784
"Culture is not an excuse for crime,",608.2,785
nor is ignorance of the law.,605.1,786
"Every woman, indeed anyone who believes in womens rights, should be outraged by the appalling practices occurring on a daily basis in minority communities across Britain.",503,788
A new case of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is reported in Britain every hour.,605.1,789
"14 NHS clinics in England deal exclusively with FGM cases and 65,000 girls are thought to be at risk of FGM.",605.1,790
"The practice of breast ironing also appears to beincreasingly prevalent in the UK, with around 1,000 cases identified.",605.1,791
"Some 11,000 incidences of so-called honour crime were recorded by UK police forces during 2010-2014, and there were eighteen recorded cases of honour killings during the same period.",605.1,792
"Government research in 2011 found thatbetween 5,000 and 8,000 people are at risk of being forced into marriage every year.",201.2,793
UKIP will show zero tolerance to all these crimes and aim to eradicate them from our country.,605.1,794
Bigots who shout racism or Islamophobia will not intimidate us.,608.2,795
They legitimise the problem and demonstrate their ignorance.,608.2,796
We are proud of our position.,608.2,797
They need to get their moral compasses fixed.,608.2,798
"The Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act (1985) made FGM illegal, but there has not been a single successful prosecution.",605.1,800
"The current approach, which focuses on education and support alone, fails thousands of girls every year.",605.1,801
"In addition to current programmes, we will also: Make failure to report a known instance of FGM a criminal offence",605.1,802
"Implement a screening programme for girls identified to be at risk of FGM from birth to age sixteen, consisting of annual non-invasive physical check-ups",605.1,803
Carry out additional check-ups on girls at risk when they return to the UK from trips to countries where FGM is known to be customary,605.1,804
Make FGM an indictable offence (meaning it can only be heard in the Crown Court) with a sentencing starting point of six years.,605.1,805
"Measures similar to these are already law in France, which has a far better record than we have on preventing and prosecuting FGM.",605.1,806
These policies are already proven to work.,605.1,807
They will protect girls from FGM by deterring those who would harm them and help provide essential evidence to mount prosecutions when FGM has taken place.,605.1,808
Prosecutions in France have played a vital role in getting parents to abandon the practice of FGM.,605.1,809
"Parents are complicit in allowing their children to be cut, and we will instruct police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service to rigorously investigate and pursue them, as well as those who actually commit the act.",605.1,810
Women at risk from their own families and communities need our help and protection.,605.1,812
"UKIP will uphold the integrity of British law and ensure it applies to each individual equally, irrespective of his or her race, faith or ethnic origin.",605.1,813
We will: Make breast ironing a specific criminal offence,605.1,814
"Add offences committed to protect family or personal honour to the Sentencing Councils list of aggravating factors, giving leave to impose greater sentences",605.1,815
Prosecute all cases of child and forced marriage and refuse permanent leave to remain and/or British citizenship to any adult known to have procured a child marriage for themselves or their children,605.1,816
Make certain that neither the legal nor the welfare system in Britain ever recognises polygamy,603,817
"Include information on cultural crimes in safeguarding training for teachers, staff and school governors.",605.1,818
UKIP will ban wearing of the niqab and the burqa in public places.,608.2,820
Face coverings such as these are barriers to integration.,608.2,821
"We will not accept these de-humanising symbols of segregation and oppression,",608.2,822
nor the security risks they pose.,605.1,823
Suggestions that UKIP is undermining liberty with this policy are absurd.,201.1,824
There is no human right to conceal your identity.,201.1,825
"If anything prevents liberty, it is the niqab, by preventing women from being perceived as individuals in their own right.",201.1,826
"We want to open opportunities to all women, so that they can participate fully in life and in the workplace.",503,827
"Clothing that hides identity, puts up barriers to communication, limits employment opportunities, hides evidence of domestic abuse, and prevents intake of essential vitamin D from sunlight is not liberating.",503,828
We stand in solidarity with women worldwide who are rebelling against the imposition of the niqab and burqa.,503,829
"Three years ago, the Trojan Horse scandal revealed how Islamists had attempted to take over several schools in Birmingham and use them to propagate their warped ideology.",605.1,831
"The plot nearly succeeded, and hundreds of young minds were at risk.",605.1,832
We must never again be caught napping like this: we must wake up to the reality that extremism is taking hold in our country.,605.1,833
"Until such time as the Muslim community is better integrated, UKIP proposes: Immediately putting into Special Measures schools found to be exposing children to Islamism",605.1,840
"Giving schools the right to dismiss forthwith any teachers, members of staff or governors found to be actively supporting radical mosques or imams",605.1,841
"Requiring Ofsted to conduct snap inspections of schools when parents or pupils have raised concerns that: Girls are being offered unequal access to music, dance, PE or drama lessons, or are otherwise discriminated against",503,842
"Anti-Western, anti-Semitic, or anti-equality views are being expressed by staff or governors",503,843
Muslim or non-Muslim pupils who challenge or do not share hardline views are being bullied or ridiculed.,503,844
"Strong actions, not political correctness, are needed now, or we will all suffer the consequences in the future.",605.1,845
UKIP is the only party prepared to put its faith in imprisonment and a strong police force as the bedrock of our criminal justice system.,605.1,851
"We will promote rehabilitation, but also believe in containment, deterrence and punishment.",605.1,852
"The wealthy might feel safe, secreted away in large houses in lovely areas, living behind electronic gates and protected by top-of-the range burglar alarms.",503,856
It is a different story for working class people forced to watch as their communities are blighted by the criminality and antisocial behaviour perpetrated by a wrecking minority on their less gentrified estates.,605.1,857
It seems only UKIP will stand up for them.,701,858
Our approach to criminality contrasts starkly with that of the other parties.,605.1,859
"As Home Secretary, Theresa May was soft on crime.",605.1,860
"She went the way of the Labour party, putting the human rights of offenders before those of their victims, tiptoeing around even the most hardened criminals, instead of concentrating on protecting the public.",605.1,861
We will not tolerate a perverse criminal justice system that allows criminals to get away with serious crimes or repeat offending because the police are under-resourced.,605.1,862
"We will train and deploy 20,000 more police and employ 7,000 more prison officers.",605.1,863
"The thin blue line is no longer just thin, it is malnourished and emaciated.",605.1,865
"In their report of March 2017, Her Majestys Inspectorate of Constabulary highlighted an erosion of preventative policing and revealed a catalogue of failings.",605.1,866
"Emergency calls were deliberately downgraded when fewer officers were on duty, and gang violence was not classified as organised crime to avoid having to deploy additional resources.",605.1,867
"High-risk domestic abuse victims were downgraded to a lower level of concern, and officers were assigned to investigations they were not qualified to conduct.",605.1,868
Forces struggled to find resources to investigate violent crimes.,605.1,869
"Theresa Mays legacy as Home Secretary has been to produce a police force that cannot be relied upon to investigate crime properly, and crime figures that cannot be relied upon at all.",605.1,874
"The job of police officers is to prevent crime, keep people safe and catch criminals.",605.1,875
We will give them the resources they need to succeed.,605.1,876
"We will train and employ 20,000 more frontline officers and equip them with all they need to conduct proper investigations, and track and arrest more suspects.",605.1,877
These jobs will first be offered to ex-armed forces personnel.,605.1,878
"In 2014, Theresa May weakened Stop and Search, saying it was undermining relations with ethnic minority communities.",605.1,880
"UKIP warned this would lead to an increase in knife crime and, sadly, we have been proved right.",605.1,881
Knife crime rose 24 per cent in London last year when 61 people were knifed to death in the city.,605.1,882
Sixteen people were stabbed and killed in London in just the three weeks before this manifesto went to print.,605.1,883
Theresa May showed weakness and inconsistency on Stop and Search and this has cost lives.,605.1,884
UKIP agrees with the father of murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor: the police need greater Stop and Search powers to combat knife crime.,605.1,885
UKIP will reinstate full Stop and Search powers to the police and reduce the burden of paperwork police have to complete each time they exercise this function.,605.1,886
"Our prisons are overcrowded, understaffed, and rapidly becoming hotbeds of violence and Islamist extremism.",605.1,888
Drug use is also rising.,605.1,889
"These factors unite to increase the risk of prison rioting, or of prison officers losing control, which could lead to serious injury or loss of life.",605.1,890
This vicious circle has to stop.,605.1,891
"UKIP will: Boost the number of prison officers by 7,000: There are 7,000 fewer prison officers, supervising officers and custodial managers working in England and Wales than in 2010.",605.1,892
Restoring this number will restore adequate staffing levels.,605.1,893
These jobs will be offered first to ex-armed forces personnel.,605.1,894
"Reduce Prison Overcrowding: 68 per cent of our prisons are overcrowded, according to the latest Ministry of Justice statistics.",605.1,895
"The Conservatives plan to build four new prisons, close older jails, and reduce the numbers of people incarcerated to solve the problem.",605.1,896
UKIP thinks this is potentially disastrous: those who benefit most from prison are the law-abiding people who do not go.,605.1,897
We will keep all existing prisons open and continue with the current building programme.,605.1,898
"We will send as many as possible of the 13,000 foreign nationals in our jails back to their home countries",601.2,899
"and, in future, will seek to have foreign criminals serve sentences in their countries of origin.",605.1,900
If they wish to appeal against their convictions they must do so from their country of origin and pay their own costs.,605.1,901
Our tough immigration policies will weed out potential troublemakers.,601.2,902
Cut Violence in Prisons: Serious assaults within prison walls are increasing.,605.1,903
"Two prison guards are attacked every day, a threefold rise in just four years, and there were also 18,510 prisoner¬on-prisoner attacks during 2016.",605.1,904
We will bring all those who assault prison staff or other prisoners before the courts.,605.1,905
"Tackle Illegal Drug Use: Prisoners testing positive for illegal substances while in prison will be limited to closed visits from friends or family for six months, meaning they will be separated from their visitors by glass.",605.1,906
"Prisoners are encouraged to deal with drug addiction problems during their incarceration, and we do them no favours by not taking a tough line.",605.1,907
"Address Islamist Extremism: All criminals are at risk of becoming radicalised behind bars, not just the 14.4 per cent of Muslim prisoners.",605.1,908
"The Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think-tank, says prisons risk becoming universities of terror unless extremists are segregated from the wider prison population.",605.1,909
"This approach is shortly to be piloted at three prisons, along with de-radicalisation programmes.",605.1,910
We will monitor progress and extend these schemes if they are successful.,605.1,911
"We will also: Ensure no prisoner has better perks than any other, whatever their faith",503,912
"Refuse admission to prisons to any imam, preacher or individual known to promote views contrary to British values",601.1,913
Give prison governors new powers to impose measures to combat Islamic extremism and gang violence in prisons.,605.1,914
"We will review the sentencing regime for police, prison staff or other law enforcement officials convicted of crimes.",605.1,915
"We take an especially dim view of corruption, for which we will impose minimum five-year sentences.",605.1,916
"The Sentencing Council produces guidelines listing aggravating factors which make a crime more serious, so it may incur a higher sentence on conviction.",605.1,918
We propose that so-called honour crimes should be added to that list.,605.1,919
"We will also make it clear that the aggravating factor of racial or religious motivation may apply to any offender, of any race or faith.",605.1,920
"This Act relaxed opening hours for pubs, bars and clubs and increased the number of establishments able to serve alcohol.",605.1,922
The social consequences have not resembled the continental-style café culture Tony Blair claimed it would.,605.1,923
"A survey of emergency workers carried out in 2015 by the Institute of Alcohol Studies revealed 52 per cent of paramedics, 42 per cent of A&E doctors and three-quarters of police officers have been attacked in the course of their duties by people who were intoxicated.",605.1,924
"To protect emergency workers from abuse, we will repeal the 2003 Licensing Act and bring in new legislation to reduce the density of alcohol outlets and restrict trading times.",605.1,925

The EAW is in fundamental opposition to the principle of innocent until proven guilty.,201.2,928

"By reclaiming our status as an independent, democratic nation, the UK can through force of example play a role similar to that it played through force of arms in two World Wars: that of a shining star illuminating the way ahead for other European countries.",601.1,941
"There is no question about it: when we leave the EU, Britain will retain her status as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and as a leading member of NATO, the organisation that has been the bedrock of our security since the aftermath of the Second World War.",107,945
"We will sustain our position within the special intelligence Five Eyes alliance with the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia,",107,946

"Indeed, Brexit means we can help re-invigorate the Commonwealth, with trade agreements and increased engagement to give these friendly countries parity of esteem in our foreign relations policy.",101,948
UKIP will stand up for the territorial integrity of British dependencies and territories.,601.1,949
We remain full committed to upholding the right to self-determination of the people of the Falkland Islands who overwhelmingly wish to remain British.,101,950

"However, we will of course continue our close cooperation with our European partners on matters of defence and security once we have left the EU.",108,953
"In the context of an American administration that is re-evaluating its defence commitment to Europe, Britains position as our continents premier defence power is an asset that will strengthen our hand in Brexit negotiations.",601.1,954
UKIP will work constructively with President Trump.,101,955
"We value the special relationship between the UK and the US, and do not believe gesture politics from establishment politicians seeking to demonstrate their disapproval of his administration is helpful to our national interest.",101,956
The values shared between the US and the UK will always outlast individual political administrations in either country.,101,957
We are confident the Trump administrations positive attitude to Britain will lead to a swift free trade agreement bolstering our common interests.,101,958
"However, UKIP does not believe in surrendering our national freedom of action,",109,959
"nor pledging our armed forces in advance to any other nation when it comes to important foreign policy decisions, such as those that occurred in the run-up to the Iraq War.",109,960
UKIP opposed Britain becoming involved in this conflict from the start.,103.1,961
UKIP supports the recent tradition of consulting parliament before our forces are committed to combat situations.,202.1,962
We are proud of our pro-active role in opposing British participation in the planned bombing of Syria in 2013.,105,963
"The results of western military intervention across North Africa and the Middle East in the 21st century have been disastrous, from Libya, to Syria, Iraq, and even to Afghanistan, where a necessary initial intervention lost momentum and focus because forces were switched to the Iraq War.",103.1,964
"In the years ahead, UKIP will avoid allowing Britain to become embroiled in foreign wars.",105,965
We will maintain our sceptical view of neo¬conservative arguments for attempting to deliver change in the Middle East at gunpoint.,103.1,966
You cannot bomb people into democracy.,103.1,967
"When it comes to the greatest threat to world peace and the British way of life, UKIP is convinced this comes from the spread of radical Islam across the globe.",106,968
The threshold for seeking to topple anti-Islamist leaders will therefore remain very high indeed.,104,969
We want to see a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and will put our full diplomatic weight behind seeking this outcome.,106,970
"UKIP will seek better relations with Russia, but only on the basis of Russia changing its approach to international relations, no longer seeking to intervene in and manipulate the conduct of politics in western nations,",103.1,971
and having respect for the territorial integrity of other countries.,103.1,972
"We see Russia as a potential important ally in the struggle against Islamist terror,",104,973

UKIP will retain Britains independent nuclear deterrent.,104,975
"Give the continued existence of rogue states such as North Korea, any other policy would be utterly irresponsible.",104,976

"increase the number of those serving in our armed  forces by 20,000,",104,980
"properly equip those on active service,",104,981
"and look after  those who are prepared to put their lives on the line for our country,  in service and when discharged.",104,982
US President Theodore Roosevelt said the key to success in foreign policy was to speak softly but carry a big stick.,104,987
"In the modern era, British politicians have all too often shouted loudly while carrying a matchstick.",104,988
"In 2010, the new Conservative-led government began including the Single Intelligence Account, Armed Forces pensions and Trident in the defence budget, rather than accounting for them separately.",104,989
"This sleight of hand budgeting allowed them to claim they were still meeting our NATO obligation to spend two per cent of GDP on defence, when in fact our armed forces were being steadily depleted.",104,990
Tory cuts to the equipment programme and manpower have been deep: they have put our national security at serious risk.,104,991
"The Conservatives ignored their manifesto pledge to keep army numbers above 82,000: reductions imposed on the defence budget since 2010 have shrunk the Army to 78,000, its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars.",104,993
Main battle tank strength has been cut by 40 per cent and there has been a 35 per cent cut in self-propelled artillery.,104,994
"The governments ambition to recruit 30,000 personnel to the Territorial Army to address the shortfall in regular army manpower was a fatally flawed concept and undeliverable from the start.",104,995
Regulars and Territorials are not interchangeable.,104,996
"In 1982, the Royal Navy sent 115 ships, including two aircraft carriers carrying jet fighters, plus 23 destroyers and frigates, to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina.",104,998
"Today, after decades of cuts, the Royal Navy is a shadow of its former self.",104,999
The surface fleet is currently down to just 17 frigates and destroyers.,104,1000
"The Navys Harpoon missiles will retire from the fleets frigates and destroyers in 2018 without a replacement, and there will be a two-year gap without helicopter-launched anti-shipping missiles.",104,1001
"The Royal Navy has shed people faster than ships: we had 39,000 sailors in 2000; now they number only 29,000.",104,1002
"The Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2015 vowed to stop cutbacks on the fleet, but the damage has already been done.",104,1003
The two new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers will not be operational before 2020.,104,1004
"Even then, serious questions remain about whether the Royal Navy will be able to man, operate and protect them.",104,1005
It would take nearly every ship in the current surface fleet to form an effective carrier group so they could be deployed.,104,1006
"Moreover, it has been widely reported that each carrier will routinely deploy with only a dozen F-35B aircraft.",104,1007
"In comparison, the two Royal Navy carriers involved in the Falklands Conflict carried twenty-odd Harrier jump jets each.",104,1008
"The Royal Air Force is shedding one sixth of its staff, some 7,000 personnel, and 295 aircraft.",104,1010

"In 2015, the UK found itself in the embarrassing position of having to call upon surveillance assistance from US, Canadian, French and German aircraft, more than 20 times.",104,1013
Many frontline pilots have been on active combat operations for more than a decade.,104,1014
Combat fatigue has taken its toll and experienced aircrew are leaving the service.,104,1015
The weapons officers who fly behind the pilot in the two-seater Tornado are particularly in short supply.,104,1016
"After decades of Treasury-driven budgetary cuts, the RAF finds itself in the unhappy position of doing less with less, with no prospect of an upturn in its fortunes.",104,1017
The Tories have threatened our security by leaving huge holes in our national defences.,104,1019
"They have failed the British people, who must remain well protected in an increasingly dangerous world,",104,1020
"and those who put their lives on the line for us, who must be properly equipped.",104,1021
"Britain must have a well resourced, properly manned, fit-for-purpose armed force, one with the capability to defend simultaneously Gibraltar and the Falklands Islands, contribute to one major theatre operation and several peacekeeping missions.",104,1022
"UKIP will spend a genuine two per cent of GDP on defence, and scale up defence spending by an additional £1 billion per year by the end of the parliament.",104,1023
UKIP will reverse the de¬militarisation of our country and rebuild our Armed Forces.,104,1024
UKIP will overhaul the wasteful defence procurement process.,303,1026
"It has lacked proper scrutiny,",202.1,1027
"been based on protectionism rather than on the needs of our Armed Forces,",304,1028
and is subject to inappropriate lobbying and cronyism on a massive scale.,304,1029
"Even Gordon Brown railed against the incestuous relationship between the Ministry (of Defence) and the arms world, although he did nothing about it.",304,1030
Defence contracts regularly run massively over budget and over time.,303,1031
Botched projects have become the norm.,303,1032
"Despite the fact that Defence Equipment and Support (the organisation responsible for purchasing equipment) employs 12,300 people, one for every six full time soldiers in the British Army, it has failed to deliver value for money for taxpayers",303,1033
and has left service personnel at risk.,104,1034
"UKIP will end the cosy relationship between ministers, officials and arms firms that lies at the heart of poor defence procurement decision-making.",304,1035
The political class has got its priorities so wrong.,304,1037
"In February this year, Theresa May announced MPs would get a £1,049 pay rise.",304,1038
"Meanwhile, she capped pensions for 140,000 British war heroes and widows, giving them just £1.10 per week.",504,1039
"In 2015, UKIP promised to create a new Veterans Administration, organisationally independent and financially separate from the Ministry of Defence.",705,1040
This is still a priority for us: Britain must do more for veterans.,705,1041
The Veterans Administration will have its own minister and work with existing veteran services and charities.,705,1043
"It will provide a single point of contact for veterans in a range of fields: health care, housing, counselling, education and training, rehabilitation, hospital care, access to financial services, benefits and memorials.",705,1044
"The department will also have responsibility for issues such as bereavement support, homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse and veterans mental health.",705,1045
"The Veterans Administration will issue a veterans service card to ensure fast-track access to NHS and mental health care,",504,1046
"and award a National Defence Medal to all veterans, irrespective of rank or length of service.",601.1,1047
"No veteran should be homeless, let alone have to sleep rough on the street, yet this is happening because the Government is not enforcing a law stating military heroes must be offered homes.",705,1049
"UKIP will enforce this law, and build eight halfway house veterans hostels, each with 200 rooms and modelled on similar hostels already in operation.",705,1050
We will also assign 500 affordable rent homes every year to ex-forces personnel.,705,1051
"UKIP will guarantee a job in the police service, prison service or border force for anyone who has served in the Armed Forces for a minimum of 12 years.",705,1053
"Our Boots to Business policy will help ex-service personnel set up their own businesses by offering loans, grants, free professional advice and mentoring to any veteran who wishes to pursue an entrepreneurial career after leaving the forces.",705,1054
"UKIP will not allow veterans to be chased, harassed and intimidated by over-zealous human rights lawyers, most of whom are unlikely even to begin to comprehend the pressures of the battlefield.",705,1056
We will bring forward legislation preventing veterans from being pursued for years by police and prosecutors for actions taken whilst in the service of the Crown.,705,1057
We will not permit veterans to be tried over allegations of misconduct dating from half a century ago under any circumstances.,705,1058
"Veterans should not be sleeping in the streets or consigned to the dole, nor hounded for doing their jobs.",705,1059
"UKIP is determined they will get the help, care and respect they deserve.",705,1060
"UKIP has long believed that trade, not aid, is the most secure route to economic prosperity for the developing world.",407,1066
We will reduce the foreign aid budget,109,1067
and advance free trade deals to the poorest nations to help lift them out of poverty.,407,1068
"A 2015 World Economic Forum study concluded that in the developing world there was no effect of aid on growth, yet UKIP is the only party in this election offering voters a real choice when it comes to foreign aid spending.",109,1072
"The others all back spending 0.7 per cent of our Gross National Income (GNI), regardless of results.",109,1073
"When carefully targeted, aid can feed the poor and heal the sick, but regular aid payments may act as a disincentive to economic growth.",109,1074
"Between 1970 and 1998, when aid flows to Africa were at their peak, poverty in Africa worsened.",109,1075
"Despite receiving over £400 billion in aid over the past forty years, the continent remains poor.",109,1076
It is time to consign to history the idea that pouring ever-greater sums into the foreign aid budget is a signal of our virtue.,109,1077
It is a hangover from the era of celebrity-driven politics personified by Tony Blair and David Cameron.,109,1078
"In many cases, it can be demonstrated to be doing more harm than good.",109,1079
Leaving the EU gives us the chance to boost the fortunes of developing countries by striking Free Trade Agreements with them.,407,1080
UKIP will make Transition to Trade offers to some of the biggest aid recipient nations as we gradually reduce the amount of UK taxpayers money we send to them.,407,1081
UKIP will close down the Department for International Development.,109,1082
We will repeal the law requiring us to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI on foreign aid,109,1083
and reduce the aid budget to 0.2 per cent of GNI over time.,109,1084
"This will save at least £10 billion a year, which we will spend on other priorities, such as the NHS.",109,1085
A single Minister For Overseas Development working out of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will administer aid.,109,1086
"This will bring Britains aid spending into line with that of other advanced nations, such as the USA.",109,1087
"We will still be spending around £4 billion annually, which is more in cash terms than Spain and Italy combined.",107,1088
"We will continue to fund projects that make a real difference: clean water programmes, childhood inoculations, medical assistance, and disaster and emergency relief.",107,1089
"We will offer contracts for aid programmes to British providers first, so that we are better able to see what results we get from various programmes and track spending.",107,1090
"We will not allow taxpayers money to be spent by aid organisations such as the International Rescue Committee, who pay David Miliband a salary of £425,000.",303,1091
British medical expertise and disaster support is among the best in the world.,601.1,1093
"Our help is always welcome in the aftermath of natural disaster, disease epidemic, or famine.",107,1094
"To increase the contribution Britain can make in times of global crises, UKIP will commission, equip and staff a Naval Ocean-Going Surgical Hospital (NOSH).",107,1095
"As 95 per cent of the worlds largest 100 cities are port cities, and 90 per cent of the worldspopulation live within 200 miles of the sea, this will be an extremely useful way to deliver large-scale relief to our armed forces on activeoperational duties,",104,1096
"to civilians and refugees in war zones,",107,1097
or to undertake humanitarianmissions in peacetime.,107,1098
The new ship willalso provide useful reinforcement in case of emergencies here at home.,104,1099
"The new NOSH will have at least 500 beds, a flight deck and large hangar to support several helicopters, as well as vehicle decks.",104,1100
"It will be a highly visible ambassador for Britain,",601.1,1101
"andwill replace the Royal Navys current sea-borne medical capability, RFA ARGUS, which is set to retire in 2020.",104,1102
"It will not carry weapons, giving it the full protection of the Geneva Convention in times of war.",104,1103
"This flagship project will help confirm Britains status as a force for good in the world,",601.1,1104
while simultaneously expanding our naval capabilities.,104,1105
UKIP will not be sorry to see the back of the EUs morally repugnant trade tariff regime.,407,1107
It has blatantly accentuated poverty in some of the poorest nations on earth.,407,1108
"African farmers, for example, may export raw cocoa beans to the EU without paying any tariffs, but if they want to export chocolate, tariffs are high.",407,1109
It is the same with coffee.,407,1110
"In 2014, the whole of Africa made just under £1.6 billion from raw coffee bean exports, but Germany alone made £2.6 billion just by exporting roasted beans, despite not growing a single coffee crop.",407,1111
"UKIP will seek to support the economies, infrastructure development, education, health, agriculture and trading capacity of developing nations.",107,1115
"We will not engage in unethical trade practices that harm or inhibit their trade, traditional lifestyles, or natural resources.",416.2,1116
This will be a far better way to help developing nations lift themselves out of poverty and become self-sufficient.,107,1117
Even Bono has now admitted it.,107,1118
"Of all the insults thrown at the Leave campaign by the Remain camp, one of the most ludicrous was the little Englanders taunt.",601.1,1120
"The polar opposite is true: those who voted for Brexit could see a brighter, more global and economically successful future outside the confines of a contracting and ever-more protectionist EU.",110,1121
"For decades our EU membership has been a factor in our diluted economic growth,",410,1123
"flat-lining wages,",701,1124
and diminishing influence on the world stage.,601.1,1125
"In future, we shall have wider and easier access to overseas markets.",407,1126
"For British consumers, choice will increase,",401,1127
"prices will fall,",401,1128
and we will not be so reliant upon monopoly suppliers.,401,1129
"Increased competition is likely to fuel innovation and offer opportunities for the transfer of expertise and technology,",411,1130
"which in turn means more jobs,",701,1131
and a stronger economy.,410,1132
"Leaving the EU is not about becoming little Englanders, it is about putting the Great back into Great Britain.",601.1,1133
It is about embracing new trading markets in all seven continents of the globe.,407,1134
"Naturally, we should like to agree a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU, and continue to trade on the same basis as at present.",407,1135
"As the UK is the EUs largest single export market, the EU should want to reach a swift and sensible trade deal with us.",407,1136
"However, if the EU continues to make unreasonable demands in return for even talking about free trade, then we must be prepared to walk away.",110,1137
"In circumstances where the EU continues to insist Britain pay a huge divorce settlement of up to 100 billion, or continues to demand we accept the on-going jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and allow the free movement of people, trading with the EU within the legal framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would be the far better option.",110,1138
"Not having an FTA with the EU will not prevent our trading with EU businesses, so talk of a cliff edge is pure hyperbole.",110,1139
"Neither could we crash out of the EU, because trade is not going to stop, whatever happens.",407,1140
"It should also be remembered that the EU is itself a member of the WTO and subject to its rules, so therefore extremely limited in any hostile action it could take against Britain.",110,1141
"Trading on WTO terms will never be a punishment option, but may be an economically sound choice.",407,1142
"Post-Brexit, UKIPs aim is to establish the UK on the world market as a low tax, low regulation economy.",401,1144
"The UK will contribute to the World Trade Organisations aim for trade to flow as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.",407,1145
"We will reduce tariffs wherever possible, unless initiating anti-dumping measures,",407,1146
and oppose the establishment and continuance of protectionist customs unions such as the EU.,407,1147
"The sooner we can start making our own free trade deals with countries around the world, the better.",407,1148
"Leaving the EU is a win-win situation for UK trade,",407,1149
"our global business partners,",407,1150
and developing nations.,107,1151
"Countries are already queuing up to make trade deals with Britain: we can only hope work is already underway to negotiate, conclude, sign and ratify those deals so they that can come into effect on day one after Brexit.",407,1152
Everyone understands the frustration of being stuck in a traffic jam or going nowhere on a delayed train or bus.,411,1154
UKIP will improve our existing transport infrastructure instead of investing in vanity projects such as HS2 and the environmentally destructive third runway at Heathrow.,411,1155
Britains prosperity depends upon an operational road system and reliable public transport networks.,411,1159
"When transport goes wrong, it has an impact on our economy and our businesses, and makes life miserable and stressful for those experiencing delays and cancellations.",411,1160
"UKIP will get the basics right, and not waste hundreds of billions of pounds on unnecessary transport projects.",303,1161
Rail travel is essential but HS2 is not.,303,1163
"This High Speed Rail project is unaffordable,",303,1164
"requires massive borrowing,",414,1165
"will blight peoples homes,",501,1166
and destroy valuable habitats.,501,1167
"Spending £75 billion just to save a few minutes between London and Leeds is ludicrous and, we think, unethical.",416.2,1168
UKIP will put HS2 out of its misery.,303,1169
"We will invest in upgrading existing main line services to create additional capacity, expand electrification, and improve east-west rail services and connections across the north of England.",411,1170
This will be infrastructure that genuinely supports the economic and industrial regeneration of the region.,411,1171
"A slogan,  The Northern Powerhouse, achieves nothing.",305.1,1172
Tolling increases costs to business,401,1174
"and the public,",409,1175
and adds an additional unfair burden on the already highly taxed road user.,408,1176
"Road tolls are modern-day highway robbery, and UKIP will aim to remove existing tolls from publicly owned roads and block the introduction of new toll roads.",408,1177
UKIP opposes the proposed new Thames Crossing in Thurrock and will look to re-open a consultation for a new crossing further east.,411,1178
"This will include the option for a crossing through Canvey Island, linking the A1 30 to the M2 in Kent.",411,1179
Electrically propelled vehicles are now a serious option for many families but the charging infrastructure is not keeping pace.,411,1181
"UKIP will support the installation of rapid charging stations in towns and cities, and encourage off street parking and charging provision in all new housing and industrial developments through the local planning process.",411,1182
"In the 1990s, the EU and our government promoted diesel vehicles, claiming they were more env ronmentally friendly because they produced less carbon dioxide.",304,1184
Incentives such as higher taxes on petrol and cuts to Vehicle Excise Duty for diesel cars worked and diesel car ownership shot up.,304,1185
"The experts, however, have changed their advice.",304,1186
Policy has now U-turned.,304,1187
Punitive taxes are being slapped on diesel cars and there are calls to ban them from city centres.,304,1188
"A scrappage scheme giving diesel car owners up to £2,000 to get rid of their vehicles has also been introduced, and UKIP supports this;",409,1189
"however, we will combine it with an incentive scheme encouraging drivers to exchange their vehicles for electric or hybrid models.",409,1190
"UKIP will prevent diesel drivers from being penalised through higher taxes, parking fees, or emissions zone charging.",403,1191
People bought their vehicles in good faith on government advice.,304,1192
Milking them now for money that simply goes into the Treasury is unacceptable.,304,1193
Rural bus services are vital for those living in the countryside who do not have the financial means or the ability to drive.,411,1195
UKIP will provide start-up grants to support community bus operators using smaller and more efficient buses where commercial operators have cut essential services.,301,1196
Air Passenger Duty has risen rapidly since its introduction in 1994.,408,1198
This is a tax on holidays,409,1199
as well as an additional cost to business.,401,1200
"We will freeze APD at current levels and, when possible in future, seek to reduce it with the long-term objective of scrapping it completely.",401,1201
"Living under a flight path is damaging to health and wellbeing, and the expansion of Heathrow airport will make matters worse for many thousands more people.",501,1203
UKIP is dismayed the Conservatives have torn up their 2010 manifesto pledge not to go ahead with the third runway.,501,1204
"However, there is a clear commercial need for additional airport capacity in the South East, and UKIP is delighted a £100 million investment plan to revive aviation at Manston Airport in Kent is now on the table.",411,1205
This would not have been possible without the tireless campaigning of UKIP councillors.,305.1,1206
"An American logistics company has unveiled plans to acquire the 750-acre site, and use it as a base for at least a dozen aircraft.",411,1207
Thanet District Council is hoping to become a partner in a compulsory purchase order for the site.,411,1208
UKIP will continue to support the expansion of smaller regional airports.,411,1209
"We will keep a record of all foreign vehicles entering the UK by introducing a windscreen mounted identification tag, which can be purchased prior to entry.",605.1,1211
"This will help identify overseas drivers who break UK traffic laws and facilitate enforcement action, which can be taken prior to exit from the country.",605.1,1212
"Brexit will not put our countryside, our marine environment, or our wildlife at risk.",501,1219
The idea that our membership of the EU has been only good for our environment is quite simply false.,501,1220
"In some ways we have benefited, but in others our natural environment has suffered as  a consequence of EU policy.",501,1221
The EUs Common Agricultural Policy has damaged our countryside.,501,1222
The Common Fisheries Policy has devastated fish stocks around our coastline.,501,1223
"The way the EU  and our government  embraced diesel proved to be disastrous, even fatal.",501,1224
The Water Framework Directive led to serious flooding in many parts of the country by preventing river dredging.,501,1225
Repealing this directive will spare homeowners the misery of flooding,501,1226
and exorbitant insurance premiums.,408,1227
"UKIP will promote evidence-based environmental schemes,",501,1228
"and safeguard protection for Britains wildlife, nature reserves, areas of outstanding natural beauty, countryside, and coastlines in a new Environmental Protection Act, prioritising policies to protect our precious countryside for future generations.",501,1229
Current legislation does not go far enough in protecting natural woodland habitats.,501,1231
"We will amend the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) to give ancient woodlands wholly exceptional status, putting them on a par with listed buildings, registered parks and gardens, and World Heritage Sites.",501,1232
Major infrastructure projects will be required to give much more respect to irreplaceable rural capital projects which enhance the local environment or help recovery from environmental disasters natural habitats.,416.2,1233
HS2 is a prime example of this: we will scrap HS2 and ensure no infrastructure project will ever again be allowed permission to wreak such catastrophic environmental damage.,416.2,1234
UKIP will amend planning legislation to promote inclusion of trees and open space into new deve opments.,501,1243
"The need to build new homes must be countered by the human need to breathe in open, green spaces.",501,1244
"We will also require new developments to use permeable or porous surfacing materials for single-storey, ground level domestic car parking and front gardens, so rainwater can drain away to help prevent flooding.",501,1245
"Figures analysed by the RAC Foundation show some seven million front gardens now contain concrete and cars rather than flowers and grass, a total space roughly equivalent to 100 Hyde Parks or 72 Olympic Parks.",501,1246
32 million single-use plastic bottles are used every day in the UK. 16 million go directly to landfill or end up as litter.,501,1248
The Marine Conservation Society estimates around 160 plastic bottles per mile are scattered on our beaches.,501,1249
"After years of sunlight and pounding waves, they break down into micro¬plastics which are ingested by plankton, shellfish, shrimp, fish, birds, turtles, other sea animals and ultimately humans.",501,1250
We will investigate the practicality of introducing a deposit scheme on plastic drinks bottles to encourage recycling.,501,1251
"When we leave the EU, we will leave the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)  and regain the power to prioritise our own farming objectives,",703.1,1257
"boost our own  food security,",703.1,1258
"reform our attitude to farming,",703.1,1259
"animal welfare and wildlife  management,",501,1260
and reinvigorate our rural economy.,703.1,1261
"Naturally, farmers will be nervous about what might replace the CAP and the subsidy system they have become used to over forty years or so.",703.1,1265
"However, UKIP will continue to make available to the agriculture sector funds that would normally be paid to them via Brussels.",703.1,1266
We will introduce a UK Single Farm Payment (SFP) that operates in a similar way to the present EU system.,703.1,1267
The major difference will be that UKIPs SFP will be more ethical.,416.2,1268
"It will end EU discrimination in favour of larger, intensive farms, and support smaller enterprises.",403,1269
"Subsidies will be capped at £120,000 per year",703.2,1270
"and, to make sure payments reach farmers, not just wealthy landowners, we will pay only those who actually farm the land.",703.1,1271
Anti-Microbial Resistance is a problem for society as a whole.,501,1272
UKIP will consider transferring some support to those livestock producers who commit to farming without antibiotics.,501,1273
"To qualify for subsidies, land must be used for genuine agricultural purposes and meet Entry Level Stewardship conditions (2013 rules), meaning it must be managed to certain environmental standards.",501,1274
"Organic farms will be paid 25 per cent more,",501,1275
and additional support will be given to hill farmers.,703.1,1276
"There will be no set-aside, cropping or rotation restrictions.",703.1,1277
We think the British public will prefer and support UKIPs approach.,305.1,1278
Only when we have left the EU can we regain control of animal health and welfare issues.,501,1280
"Currently, EU law prevents us from banning live exports for slaughter, and prevents us from labelling food that has been ritually killed as halal or shechita.",501,1281
UKIP campaigns against the EUs stance on both.,501,1282
"It is worth noting that should Britain stay in the single market, we would still not be able to prevent the export and import of live animals destined for the meat trade and end the unnecessary suffering this causes.",501,1283
"Brexit offers the perfect opportunity to review energy policy, prioritising lower prices",412,1294
and more secure supplies.,411,1295
"There is one major problem:  a lack of MPs in Westminster who recognise the potential of a rational energy policy, and who are committed to delivering it.",411,1296
"While our major global competitors in the USA, China and India are switching to low-cost fossil fuels, this Act forces us to close perfectly good coal-fired power stations to meet unattainable targets for renewable capacity.",411,1303
"UKIP will repeal the 2008 Climate Change Act and support a diverse energy market based on coal, nuclear, shale gas, conventional gas, oil, solar and hydro, as well as other renewables when they can be delivered at competitive prices.",401,1305
"We will also withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, to enhance our industrial competitiveness.",401,1306
"According to government figures, 2.3 million households are living in fuel poverty, meaning they spend more than 10per cent of their total income to heat their homes to an adequate standard of warmth.",503,1308
"In addition to removing VAT from domestic fuel and scrapping green levies to reduce household bills by an average of £170,",504,1309
we will review the ownership and profits of British utilities and the impact on consumers of steadily rising prices.,403,1310
We will not hesitate to table legislation to address any excesseswe uncover.,403,1311
Repealing the Climate Change Act and leaving the EU means we can also reduce high commercial energy prices and prevent energy-intensive businesses from being driven offshore.,401,1313
"Problems in the steel industry have been well publicised, but similar issues apply to aluminium, chemicals, fertilisers, glass, ceramics and petroleumrefining.",401,1314
"Such companies may move to countries with lower environmental standards, and increase emissions, thereby rendering the 2008 Act even more futile.",401,1315
Energy policies pursued by Labour and the Tories are arguably increasing global emissions,501,1316
and causing Britain to lose jobs,701,1317
and investment.,408,1318
"They have created a lose-lose situation, but only UKIP is awake to the problem.",305.1,1319
"British demand for energy already exceeds our home-produced supply and unless we reduce this deficit, we will be importing more and more energy.",411,1321
This risks both our energy,411,1322
and pur economic security:,408,1323
"bills will have to be paid for in foreign currency over which we haveno control,",408,1324
and fossil fuel cost and distribution can be severely affected by international conflict.,408,1325
It would be foolhardy not to maximise home produced energy and this is why UKIP will invest in shale gas exploration.,411,1326
"If fracking is viable in Britain, we will have tapped into a source of energy that is cost-effective and delivers domestic fuel security and stability.",411,1327
"Careful utilisation of this method of gas extraction has the potential to create jobs,",701,1328
improve our industrial competitiveness,401,1329
and boost our economy.,410,1330
This makes it too great an opportunity to ignore.,411,1331
"By any measure, shale gas extraction is far safer and cleaner than coal, on which Britains Industrial Revolution was based.",411,1332
"UKIP will not, however, allow drilling for shale in our national parks or other areas of outstanding natural beauty.",501,1333
"The Conservatives may be prepared to do this, but we are not.",501,1334
We will always respect local environmental issues.,501,1335
UKIPs fundamental belief in radical democracy marks us out from the other parties.,202.1,1340
"We want real devolution, with an English Parliament.",301,1341
"We will abolish the House of Lords,",202.1,1342
"hold binding referenda on the issues that matter most to people,",202.4,1343
and introduce a fairer voting system.,202.1,1344
"The fabric of the historic Palace of Westminster is in desperate need of restoration, but perhaps it is not just the building itself that is falling apart.",202.1,1348
Are the decaying walls symptomatic of what is happening inside the mother of parliaments?,202.1,1349
Government has become bloated and unmanageable.,303,1350
Politics is corrupted by self-interest and big business.,304,1351
An unaccountable elite revels in mutual back-scratching and cronyism.,304,1352
"If the best interests of the people of this country are to be well served, our current political system needs urgent reform.",202.1,1353
"UKIP believes it is time to make our nation truly democratic, and this is how we will do it.",202.1,1354
"All votes should matter, so we will introduce a voting system that genuinely reflects the will of the people as a whole.",202.1,1356
"In the 2015 general election, UKIP got 12.6 per cent of the vote but only one seat, while the SNP won just 4.7 percent of the national vote but took 56 seats.",202.1,1357
"The current First Past the Post (FPTP) system we use for electing MPs to our national parliament is bad for voters, bad for government, and bad for democracy.",202.1,1358
"UKIP wants a fairer, more proportional voting system that makes seats match votes, and ends the inbuilt advantage the establishment parties have over smaller parties.",202.1,1359
"A proportional electoral system that delivers a parliament representative of the number of votes cast, while retaining a constituency link, is one we strongly advocate.",202.1,1360
"Originally intended to increase voter turnout and enhance democracy, postal voting has had the opposite effect, fuelling massive, systematic and organised fraud that would disgrace a banana republic, according to England and Waless senior and most experienced Election Commissioner.",202.1,1362
UKIP will reserve postal votes only for those who can show a genuine need.,202.1,1363
"Otherwise, voting must be done at polling stations.",202.1,1364
It is time for the House of Lords to go.,202.1,1366
Attempts at reform have proved counter¬productive.,202.1,1367
"The House of Lords Act 1999 replaced the majority of hereditary peers with appointees, which only increased the Prime Ministers ability to put cronies into the upper chamber.",202.1,1368
"The House of Lords is now stuffed with party donors and fundraisers, ex-MPs, and favoured former employees.",202.1,1369
"Stuffed is the right word: the House of Lords is the second biggest legislature in the world, after the Chinese National Peoples Congress.",202.1,1370
"The average cost of each peer is £115,000 per year.",303,1371
"The public widely regards the United Kingdoms current devolutionary system as fundamentally unfair, particularly to the English.",301,1373
"UKIP will put England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the same footing by instituting a new English Parliament.",301,1374
"It will sit in the chamber vacated by the House of Lords, have its own First Minister, and its 375 members will be elected under the Additional Member system of proportional representation, one or more from each traditional county or large city and 125 top-up seats.",301,1375
"All four nations will have broadly similar devolved powers and none will have power over matters affecting the whole of the UK, such as foreign policy, defence of the realm, or constitutional matters.",301,1376
"Our national parliament will be given two primary areas of responsibility: to act as an oversight body for the regional Parliaments and Assemblies, and to deal with all matters not devolved to them.",301,1378
"The size of the House of Commons will be halved to 325 directly elected members from across the four nations of the United Kingdom,",303,1379
according to a system of proportional representation.,202.3,1380
"These changes will reduce the number of politicians eligible to sit in the legislature from 1475 to 700, a net reduction of 775.",303,1381
"If 10,000 people sign an approved parliamentary petition, the government must respond.",202.4,1383
"If over 100,000 people sign it, the petition must be debated in parliament.",202.4,1384
"However, this is not real democracy.",202.4,1385
"Responses to petitions are often cursory, sometimes derisory, and debates rarely take place in the House of Commons chamber, so are usually badly attended and easily dismissed.",202.4,1386
"We will pass legislation allowing citizens to influence our legislature directly, by giving them the power to initiate binding referenda on the issues of most importance to them.",202.4,1387
"Every two years, a national referendum will be held on the issues gaining the highest numbers of signatures on approved petitions.",202.4,1388
The outcome of these referenda would be legally binding and included in the Queens Speech.,202.4,1389
UKIP will lead the way in saving the Union,601.1,1390
and ending friction in the current devolution settlement.,301,1391
"Our policies will end the need for tactical voting, which undermines democracy and freedom of political choice,",202.1,1392
"cut the cost and size of government,",303,1393
and give people a real say in how they are governed.,202.4,1394
UKIP is the real party for the people.,305.1,1395
"UKIP believes in localism, the kind that puts real power into the hands of the people.",301,1397
"Our councillors put party politics last, and believe in rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done.",305.1,1398
"When it comes to key local issues such as out-of-town supermarkets, incinerators, and major housing developments, UKIP believes in holding binding local referenda.",202.4,1402
Why should politicians and planning authorities have the final say?,202.4,1403
"UKIP is the only party to operate a no whip system, so our councillors can always vote in the best interests of residents in their wards, because they are not bound by party politics.",202.1,1404
"We oppose the cabinet system of local governance, which puts too much power in the hands of too few people.",202.1,1405
"We advocate a committee system, which brings more openness and transparency,",202.1,1406
and facilitates cross-party collaborative working.,202.1,1407
"Collecting rubbish bins promptly and regularly, removing fly-tips, filling potholes, fixing broken or dim streetlights, providing enough parking, and keeping parks and libraries open: these services should be running smoothly before councillors even think about spending money on the next local vanity project.",303,1408
UKIP believes in keeping Council Tax as low as possible.,408,1409
"We seek to cut excessive allowances for councillors, executive pay and bonuses,",303,1410
"keep advertising and promotion budgets to a minimum,",303,1411
"build partnerships with neighbouring councils to reduce costs,",303,1412
and abolish non-essential jobs and red tape.,303,1413
"UKIP will end the use of council procurement cards, which operate like credit cards, encouraging over-spending and waste.",303,1414
Staff should stick within agreed budgets.,303,1415
"UKIP will review the many statutory duties placed on local government, to assess whether the cost burden on councils and taxpayers can be reduced.",303,1416
"Councils should only be doing what they do best, not what national government wants to wash its hands of.",303,1417
"UKIP: the party with local, common sense, cost-cutting policies for local government.",303,1418
